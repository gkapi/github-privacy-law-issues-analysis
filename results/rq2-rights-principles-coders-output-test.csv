This makes Codepen embeds opt-in, since it's unclear whether loading them by default is allowed under GDPR. This does not include a mechanism to revoke consent, since it's also unclear how to do so. Deleting the value from local storage that tracks consent wouldn't do anything about the third-party cookies. Once I have clarification from Codepen, I'll follow up on this.

As a data processor, I want to query for the consent status of a data subject, so that I know what I am allowed to use.

### DETAILS
In Pro's Control Panel today an admin can create Data Use Cases. These use cases show under Consent Management in the Privacy Center for a user to opt in or out. We will add Data Sharing as a new type when creating data use cases to comply with CPRA/VCPA in #https://github.com/ethyca/fides/issues/1397 and #https://github.com/ethyca/fidesctl-plus/issues/321. 

We need to add to the Data Sharing to the existing Consent API.

- Given that a user has NOT opted in to data sharing, when I query for their ID by email then I get an empty response or a â€œnot found/404â€ and therefore now that I cannot process sensitive information.
- Given that a user has changed their opt-in status from consenting to data sharing to NOT consenting to data sharing, when I query for a their ID by email, then I get a record of the consent with a property which indicates they are opted out.",CPRA,CPRA,consent,consent,consent,1

Trello card [here](https://trello.com/c/dtlSHP3x/1156-marketing-consent-on-subscribe)


cc @jfsoul





## What needs to be done?


1. Change the wording of the consent form - TODO: this is undergoing some UX analysis but will be completed before launch.


2. Change the way that consent is persisted to Identity:





## How?


Previously we have stored marketing consent by posting to the user/me endpoint with a boolean representing whether the user checked the consent checkbox. Although we will continue to do this for now, Identity will soon start ignoring this value in favour of a [new API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDEpehzToi9aAMg4Fk7n_mnvQ_GOOf_kgOPSyWLBweA/)





### The new method


If user gives consent:


* We call Identity on the new consent-email endpoint to instruct them that the user has given consent to 'supporter' related emails. 


* Identity emails the user asking them to click a link to confirm their choice.





If user does not give consent then no call to the consent emailer is made.





### Guest users


For users who are not signed in during the checkout we create a guest user with Identity. The user then has the option to add a password on the thank you page. 





For users who do this and who have also given us marketing consent we now need to suppress the standard validation email which would otherwise be sent out when we set their password in Identity. 





This is described in more detail in [the doc mentioned above](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDEpehzToi9aAMg4Fk7n_mnvQ_GOOf_kgOPSyWLBweA/).

Adds in a switch to show users who (A) come via email and (B.1) have not repermissioned or (B.2) are not logged in (set GDPR-compliant marketing consents) a banner prompting them to repermission. Final-er looking design and copy will come later on a separate PR.





I'm displaying some crude UI this early in to check for possible collisions with the support & cookie banners. I will probably flip this switch on in CODE asap

https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/560,308630365.00000000000,15,1,1,consent,consent,GDPR - Ask users to opt-in to our privacy policy,"### Justification





In order to meet new GDPR requirements, we need to provide users with a link to the privacy policy on the sign up form and include a way to actively opt-in to our privacy policy. 





**A/C**





- [ ] The revised sign up form contains an explicit opt-in to privacy policy checkbox - **unchecked by default**.


- [ ] The revised sign up form contains an explicit opt-in to product and research communications checkbox - **checked by default**. covered in #431 


- [ ] Link to privacy and cookies policy in the acceptance language. e.g. ""I have read and agree to the privacy and cookies policy.""


- [ ] Copy linking to terms of service and community guidelines is appended to the opt-in to privacy policy checkbox string above( note: no tracking of opt-in to terms or community guidelines is needed - purely informational.)


- [ ] Sign up to Hypothesis is prevented if users do not accept the privacy policy and a tooltip is displayed with the text ""Acceptance of the privacy policy is required."" which points to the checkbox.





### Mock up


![sign up - revised language - final ammended](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5212631/39358576-753356be-4a0e-11e8-9bd1-3ebfe5976fe5.png)








**Tooltip when the form is submitted with an incomplete field.**

_Notes from @ajpeddakotla_ 





- This doesn't cover users that have already signed in. It only covers users that will be creating new accounts. 


- If users don't agree to our policy, they won't be able to create accounts. 


- We need to make sure everything we're linking to is fully available/accessible on our website.

One of the thing we need to do to be compliant is:





_With e-mail double opt-in, a new user first needs to verify their e-mail address before completing the sign-up process._





I've tried to prevent doing this on Monica since the beginning - not because I wanted to collect your email address and do nasty thing with it, but because I wanted people to sign up with fake email addresses if they wanted to.





This law will force us to confirm email addresses on signup.





We will create a new `.env` variable, called `SIGNUP_DOUBLE_OPTIN`, which will default to `TRUE`. On our hosted version, it will be set to true, but you will do whatever you want on your own instance.





Note: to be clear, we do have an email newsletter, but we only contact people who have subscribed manually and specifically to receive this newsletter. The email address used on signup is never used otherwise, other than sending reminder emails.





Changes to do:


- [ ] Create a email confirmation process

This PR contains three key pieces


- Adds an abstract-ish advert consent library & tests for setting ad consents


- Adds a very barebones Scala view to set said consents


- Adds a small react view (the radio buttons) to power the aforementioned Scala view





For now, I would like a review of the advert library as the other two bits are subject to change. I can split that in its own PR if you'd like but I feel like there's a benefit in having a basic end to end example of how this all ties together.





Ah, also my react is extremely rusty so please let me know if there's anything horribly deeply wrong in there!





The actual page is hidden under a switch as the setting is not actually honoured by the ads yet





## What is the value of this and can you measure success?


We get to continue showing personalised adverts after the GDPR cutoff date





## Does this affect other platforms - Amp, Apps, etc?


No





## Does this affect GLabs Paid Content Pages? Should it have support for Paid Content?


No





## Screenshots


Look at this beauty. (Remember that design & layout & copy is still TBD at this point.)

### Notes





- For iOS, the `extras` have already been exposed on the `AdView` instance and can conform to GDPR by including the `npa` key. Example:


```js


var adView = AdMob.createAdView({


  // -- Other parameters here --


  extras: {


    'npa': '1' // Disable personalized ads


  }


});


```


- For Android, `extras` should be passed to `requestAd`. Example:


```js


AdMob.requestAd({


  extras: {


    'npa': '1' // Disable personalized ads


  }


});


```

A site that uses Google Analytics is configured using tarteaucitron. A visitor comes to the site and does not activate the third party services by scrolling past a certain point or clicking OK - they signal their acceptance by navigating to another page on the site.





The problems with this:





1) The visit metric for the first page is lost along with any referrer information because Google Analytics is only loaded by the time they get to their second page of browsing the site.


2) Referrer information is lost as when Google Analytics is loaded it will appear that the referrer is the first page that the user visited.





Per Recital 32 of the GDPR:


""...Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subjectâ€™s agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as ... conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subjectâ€™s acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data.""





I would like to explore peoples thoughts around the idea of initialising the services (or at least those that you deem important for your purposes on first page load), once a user clicks a link to navigate (i.e. has given their consent), is it worth providing a configurable option that slightly delays the navigation to the next page to give the opportunity for some services to load and do their reporting (e.g. Google Analytics reporting the entry page visit and maintaining referrer information).

### What This Does





To be compliant with GDPR and cookie laws, we have the following changes:





* Signup now requires explicit consent to the code of conduct, ToS, and privacy policy.


    * Privacy policy will require a section on cookie usage to be fully compliant


    * Code of conduct isn't a legal requirement, but seemed like a good idea to highlight during signup


    * If the ZF team wants to use user emails for anything other than the grants site, we'll need to add another checkbox asking for explicit consent to do that.


* Adds the ability to delete users in the admin


    * Unlike other forms of delete which would just flip a status to `DELETED`, this will actually purge the system of the account


    * We may need to figure out some kind of db backup purging for #143, or exclude users from backups.


* Removes the unused `redux-persist` since we switch to cookie-based auth


    * Since user is only given cookies at signup, this removes the need for a notification due to having to agree to privacy policy. If there's ever a need for pre-auth local storage or cookies, we'll need to add a notification on visit.





### Steps to Test





* Sign up as a new user, confirm that you cannot signup without agreeing to legal stuff


* Confirm sign in / sign out persistence still works as expected


* Confirm you can delete the user in the admin, and that it completely removes them",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,consent,consent,consent,1

I'm one of the directors on the .NET Foundation board of directors and involved with the outreach and diversity action group, and we would love to be able to recommend this site as a place to find female mentors, speakers and more- but we also want to be careful with recommending lists where the people on the list have not opted in or consented to be added.





I understand that it can be difficult to gather consent after the fact (but it is doable), but maybe at least we can start by requiring that a new person has consented or opted-in.

I would have loved to talk about it in Porto ... so maybe next year :-)





Anyway, after reading you current docs and checking the available consent categories it feels to me, that you currently focus primarily on ""stored data"". Like cookies, local browser storage, WebSQL, etc.





This is neglecting the _other_ major requirement of GDPR, getting consent before sending any **personal information** to any 3rd Party. In particular this will impact all Google Maps, Youtube, Vimeo, Google Fonts, and so on includes, where a Plugin / Theme / Site includes something from a 3rd Party server and the users IP is sent to this 3rd Party vendor. As the IP is personal information, this must not happen without consent.





I would kindly ask to keep in mind, that a generic Consent API is not all about Cookies (although we all like Cookies for sure!).


Concluding, I would suggest to add another category already named something like ""3rd Party Tools"" which will facilitate for all ""Tools"" being served from 3rd Party Servers and serve the purporse to add additional value to the User Experience, the functionality of the page as well as additional, media content.





In an ideal world, I would also suggest to change the docs, regarding your current categories, to make clear, that e.g. ""Analytics"" is not just about the Analytics cookie being stored, but also that personal information is being tracked by a 3rd Party.





If you agree and like, I can go on with a PR regarding this.

We can only show personalised ads if the user has consented to personalisation. On canonical pages, this is handled using the personalisation cookie. On AMP pages, this is handled using [amp-consent](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-consent/).





We can use the `data-block-on-consent` and `data-npa-on-unknown-consent` attributes on the `amp-ad` component:





- If the user has responded affirmatively to the amp-consent component (user accepts the consent prompt), ads will be requested normally.





- If the user has responded negatively to the amp-consent component (user rejects the consent prompt), non-personalized ads will be requested.


    - If the userâ€™s response to the amp-consent is unknown (user dismisses the consent prompt)


        - By default, no ad requests are sent at all


        - If `data-npa-on-unknown-consent` is set to true, non-personalized ads will be requested





This will need to be merged and tested on the test environment.





**Describe the solution you'd like**


A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.





**Describe alternatives you've considered**


A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.





**Testing notes**


- Unit tests to ensure that we are passing the correct attributes to amp ads


- The amp-ads component should also have its own testing around what is requested.


- Can we have any integration testing to ensure that the ads received are personalised or not?





Dev insight: Will Cypress tests be required or are unit tests sufficient? Will there be any potential regression? etc

This PR enabled the TCFv2 compliant CMP for all non-US users, this is implemented using https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/consent-management-platform.





[**Trello Card**](https://trello.com/c/AH8m5Soz/3242-upgrade-to-tcfv2-cmp-on-supporttheguardiancom)





## Changes





- Upgrade `@guardian/consent-management-platform` to v4 (TCFv2 compliant support).


- Update `page.js` to call `cmp.init` using the new interface exposed by `@guardian/consent-management-platform`  v4.


- Update `thirdPartyTrackingConsent.js` to use the new `onConsentChange` function exposed by `@guardian/consent-management-platform`.  `onConsentChange` takes a callback that it executes with consent state, passed as the parameter `state`.  The value of `state` will differ when in CCPA mode (US users) and TCFv2 mode (everyone else), so the callback determines which mode we're in, and returns either ""OptedIn"" or ""OptedOut"". There is no longer an ""Unset"" (null) state, so this has been removed from the code base.


- Remove logic used to read/write the `GU_TK` cookie from thirdPartyTrackingConsent.js`.


- Remove the old-CMP component (`ConsentBanner.jsx`), it's associated styles.


- I've removed the `ccpaEnabled` switch, this was in place to fallback to the old-CMP if necessary when releasing the CCPA  CMP, I don't think there's value in this now as we're removing the old-CMP in this PR.

User profiles stores personal information, but only a UserID and Email is required. These profiles can for a person, or for an organization to allow participation as a group.


#### Details:


- **User profile:** The current version of Codalab v2 does not allow users to edit their profile. This functionality will be implemented (Figure 3). Integration of user accounts on different components (CodaBench, Codalab, ChaGrade) will be supported if needed. Userâ€™s profiles will include (* means mandatory; to protect anonymity, only a contact email is required to identify users)


- **Organizations as User:** This will allow users to organize competitions and participate in them as a group. However, being a member of an organization is not mandatory to organize/participate a challenge/benchmark. This will also allow the platform to give credits to organization members for organizing competitions or participating in them (in their visible profile). To claim organizing a challenge or participating in it, an organization member will need to have been a member of that organization at least some time during the active period of the competition. This feature could replace both the notion of teams and of admins. To avoid sharing passwords, a member of an organization, logged in with his own personal ID, could switch to any organization he/she is a member of. 


- **Meta-users** (platform administrators) will be granted the right to impersonate users. 





### Tasks


- User ID *: cannot be changed


- Display name *: To be shown on leaderboard and profile page; by default, show the user ID; this can be changed


- Contact Person Email *: can be changed


- Contact Person First Name: optional


- Contact Person Last Name: optional

  - Choice of benchmarks and competitions in which participated and rank/number of 


participants â€“ any organization member of a competition can add a competition in this list


- Opt-in/out to receive emails (to respect GDPR).

I'm not sure if this is a good way of solving these problems, so I'd like some feedback on what people think. It feels kind of convoluted and especially tacking it on now to the authentication system (that assumed a 2-state model) makes it a bit awkward (there's now 3 states: not logged in, logged in, and logged in but jailed).





This makes it possible for a user to be authenticated while not being able to use the main APIs, but only a subset, the ""jailed"" ones. This is useful if:





1. The user has not finished signing up (e.g. has not finished adding a location)


2. The user has not accepted TOS/GDPR/etc


3. The user is banned, but we'd like to show them something nicer than a ""you're banned"" at login





It makes it easy to add requirements, e.g. update a privacy policy and make sure everyone has agreed to them, or add required fields to a user profile.

To comply with privacy laws around the world, reCaptcha [should be blocked](https://complianz.io/google-recaptcha-and-the-gdpr-a-possible-conflict/) until the user has consented to marketing level cookies. We have developed an API, eventually to get merged into WP Core, which offers plugins a method to communicate the consent status to each other: cookie management plugins can set consent, other plugins can set cookies according to the consent status set by the cookie management plugins (currently supported by Complianz and Cookiebot). 





The Consent API proposal for WordPress can be found here:


https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/04/01/feature-plugin-proposal-wp-consent-api/


Github:


https://github.com/rlankhorst/wp-consent-level-api





To demonstrate how this can work, we have created an integration with the WP Consent API for Contact Form 7. You can view a working example here: https://wpconsentapi.org/contact-form-7/





To enable this feature, installing the WP Consent API is required.





The advantage of using the WP Consent API, is that it will work for each plugin that supports it. 





If the WP Consent API is not active, or if there is no  cookie management plugin, it will function as before. If these are active, consent will be asked if required (opt in, e.g. EU, UK) or it will be possible to opt out (e.g. US, CA).  





Currently the index.js file, which was changed, is not minified, as that will be handled by your release I haven't done this. 





Please let me know if you have any questions about this. 





Merging this branch won't harm existing users, but will offer your users the option to make their site compliant, as required by law in many countries.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,consent,consent,consent,1

var pbjs = pbjs || {};


pbjs.que = pbjs.que || [];


pbjs.que.push(function() {


    pbjs.setConfig({


        priceGranularity: ""high"", 


        consentManagement: {


            gdpr: {


                cmpApi: 'static',


                consentData: {


                    getTCData: {


                        tcString: tcStr,


                        gdprApplies: true,


                        purpose: {


                            consents: {


                                1: true,


                                2: true,


                                3: true,


                                4: true,


                                5: true,


                                6: true,


                                7: true,


                                8: true,


                                9: true,


                                10: true


                            }


                        }


                    }


                }


            }


        }


    });


});





has the impact that a Prebid.JS bid requests includes:





`{


  ......


  ""gdprConsent"": {


    ""consentString"": ""CO4EXq8O4EYOWADABCDEAxCsAP_AAH_AAAAAGStV_T9fb2vj-_599_t0eY1f9_63t-wzhheMs-8NyZeX_J4Wv2MyvB34JqQKGRgkunLBAQdtHGncTQgBwIlViTLMYk2MjzNKJrJEmlsbO2dYGH9Pn8XT_ZKZ70-vv__7v3___33_4GSEEmCpfAQJCWMBJNmlUKIEIVxIVAOASghGEg0sNCRQU7I4CPUACABAYAIQIAQAgohJBAAIAAElEQAgAwIBEARAIAAQAjQEIACJAEFgBIGAQACoGhYARRBKBIQYHBUcogQFSLRQTwCQgAAMAAEAABQAAYAAHAACAAAkAAKAAA.YAAAAAAAAAA"",


    ""consentRequired"": true


  },


  ......


}`





After updating to a version >= 6.19.0 the Prebid.JS request do not include the consentString any more.


The request looks now like this:


`{


  ......


  ""gdprConsent"": {


    ""consentRequired"": false


  },


  ......


}`

## Description of change


This is a maintenance PR to update the Live Connect library. Changes in the library:


- serialize multi-value attributes sent to the identity resolution endpoint as repetitive URL query parameters instead of a single comma-separated URL query parameter (not used in Prebid yet)


- derive privacy parameters for called services from the GDPR settings

GDPR is always set to 0, and there's no trace of consent string. What did I do wrong?",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,consent,consent,consent,1
https://github.com/350org/ak_intl_v3/issues/342,1265368774.00000000000,2,1,1,consent,consent,Sign > share > donate flow doesn't require GDPR opt-in selection for European users,"###  Context:
We have an alternative after-action flow used by some petition and signup pages. Instead of redirecting to a separate thanks page, it keeps users on the same page after signing, and asks them to share and then donate, eg.

https://act.350.org/sign/stop-jackdaw-gas-field-uk/
https://act.350.org/sign/custom_page_field_demo_petition/

Whether we use this flow or the standard thanks page is toggled by the custom page field ""After-action â€“ Next Step""
https://act.350.org/admin/core/allowedpagefield/after_5Faction_5Fnext_5Fstep/change/

When users select a European country on the form, they are automatically shown GDPR opt-ins and asked to opt-in to receive emails if they don't already have a privacy record on file. 

Selecting a Y or N answer to these opt-in radio boxes should be required, so people have to choose an answer to whether they would like to receive followup emails from us. This is the case for petition and signup pages which uses the standard thanks page:

https://act.350.org/sign/custom_page_field_demo_petition_standard_thanks/
https://act.350.org/sign/banks-stop-funding-destruction-argentina/

![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22962348/172732616-b4c939eb-b357-4f98-871c-de80b6a7ea90.png)

The ""Please select an option above"" message is set in the language strings:
https://act.350.org/admin/core/language/1/change/
and it actually looks like the duplication is because we have 2 versions of this, `error_privacy:missing` and `error_privacy:required`  #349 

### Bug:

However in Chrome Version 102.0.5005.61 and Firefox and Safari on mac, this EN version of the page is validating the required Name and email fields ok, but not the Europe opt-ins. You can skip the opt-ins and scroll right on down:
https://act.350.org/sign/stop-jackdaw-gas-field-uk/

### Exceptions:
Opt-ins won't be shown for European users that are recognised and already have a privacy record, so when they are hidden they of course shouldn't be required
AK's handling of GDPR is documented here: https://act.350.org/docs/manual/guide/privacy.html?highlight=privacy.html

I also noticed another bug where when content blockers are allowed in Safari, the form won't submit at all, we just see a ""loading"" beach ball -  #346

It is controlled by a cookie `pop_up_sciblog`, if there is no cookie, the opt-in is shown, and if the cookie is there, the opt-in form is not shown. 


See opt-in below:

The problem is that unless users filled up all the mandatory fields, the form doesn't work correctly. In particular, if a mandatory field is not filled up, the form sends you to an error page saying that a mandatory field was not added. When you go back to the home page, the cookie `pop_up_sciblog` is already created, so the opt-in won't appear again.





To solve the problem, I need to create a JS to show an error to users if they have not filled up the mandatory fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, and Marketing permission. I want the error to appear below each of the boxes in light red.

* [X] I have searched the issue tracker for a feature request that matches the one I want to file, without success.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
1) There is a vacuum of on-premise hostable open source whiteboard software in teaching (universities). Teachers have to use external services at their own responsibility (and I am not even sure if that is legal).
2) Draw.io is a fantastic and flexible tool (custom libraries - yeah!) for visualization of many applications in teaching (and developing curricula).
3) Being able to use draw.io with collaboration in teaching (whiteboard-function, collaborative concept development) would be fantastic :-)
4) We could not yet find a way to run draw.io with real-time (or even non-real-time) completely on premise - which is a serious show-stopper for security and privacy aware Universities in the EU: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forbids to require students to register and to have data processed on such external premises **without specific individual and optional consent** - or within the jurisdiction of the US CLOUD Act (US servers) **in general**.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like a draw.io collaborative whiteboard that is completely hosted on premise. The easiest solution I see is to allow the NC plugin to work with own instances of draw.io and/or gitlab (maybe easiest on an own gitlab instance).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A) I am currently working with local files (or files synced over NC) and processing them externally on app.diagrams.net. This is not real-time collaborative, end even requires manual version management (including the need to consolidate parallel new versions).

B) Collaboration **is** possible at gitlabs.com - but with external accounts and external data processing in the US (see GDPR above)

C) Draw.io has a Nextcloud client with auto-save function. But this is only an API to pass the authentification to an external engine (app.diagrams.net) - See above for external data processing.

D) We do run a Confluence wiki, but I have no idea how that would help us hosting collaborative real-time whiteboards in teaching, or even work collaboratively (not real-time) in developing diagrams together as a team.

**Additional context**
We do host our own gitlab, nextcloud, etc. (even a Confluence wiki).",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,consent,consent,consent,1

## **Background**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->

EU laws require people to explicitly consent to collect their data as the IP address is considered personal data. In our case, we collect IP location data, and it is crucial to introduce a mechanism to obtain user consent for this specific data processing.

## **Proposal**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->

In order to achieve GDPR compliance, we need to implement a user notification banner that informs users about the usage of their data and allows them to either accept or reject it.

When users choose to reject the usage of their data, a header should be added to requests to prevent the collection of their IP.

We could use the following plugin https://github.com/orestbida/cookieconsent

I followed the setup guide here and am getting a consent form popup working on my mobile app: https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/privacy

It looks like Unity doesn't return anything, and Admob is smart enough to know what the user selected without any developer intervention.

However, what about other ad networks?  Since I am using Admob's UMP, do I need to parse the [TC String](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#creating-a-tc-string) made by UMP and handle other ad networks in my own code, or is it expected that other ad networks will find and read this TC String and operate normally?",GDPR,GDPR,consent,consent,consent,1

  - [ ] Would that potentially conflict with the license, if that license requires attribution?


- [ ] Do we have to delete IP-addresses from changelogs, maybe after some time?


  - [ ] Can we do that in a way that still lets us tell different anonymous users apart from each other?


- [ ] Do we need to show some message / do we need some legally worded user opt-in for some things? (Subscriptions?)


- [ ] Do we need a Privacy Statement for DokuWiki.org?


  - [ ] should we provide examples other users can adjust?


  - [ ] would it be desirable to extend that with technology (eg. automatically list what data is collected when, why and how long) and provide a way for plugins to hook into that?

Hopefully you can review and approve.





I'm updating this repo and the Antora docs (will send a separate PR) with a cookie preference center upgrade that now uses geo-location to present users in California with a different cookie experience. Also because the Cloudstate website now clearly references Lightbend in the header banner of the homepage, I've updated the Privacy Policy link in the footer to point at the Lightbend.com privacy policy. Before we just had a clone of the LB policy over here, no need to have two anymore. 





I've also added a cookie listing page, that lists cookies used on thew cloudstate.io domain.

- run `yarn` or `yarn install` to install npm dependencies
- run `yarn run test --watchAll` to verify all tests still pass
- (optional) run `yarn run build` to verify the build passes
- run `yarn start` to start the webapp
- Visit any page. You should see the the cookie banner appear in the lower-left corner of the screen.

IP masking, anonymity sets, and no more cookies 





#### Checklist





Completed items are on `master` branch





- [x] Mask IPs with `Ahoy.mask_ips = true` (side effect: reduces geocoding accuracy)


- [x] Add `Ahoy.cookies = false` to function server-side without cookies


- [x] Add `Ahoy.configure({cookies: false})` to Ahoy.js to function client-side without cookies


- [x] Create readme instructions





#### IP Masking





Same approach as [Google Analytics IP Anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052)





- IPv4 - set last octet to 0


- IPv6 - set last 80 bits to zeros





#### Anonymity Sets & Cookies





Instead of cookies, use the following formula for visit and visitor tokens.





```


uuid_v5(""visit(or)/#{masked_ip_address}/#{user_agent}"")


```





Visitors with the same masked IP address (see above) and user agent combo will be grouped together into an [anonymity set](https://privacypatterns.org/patterns/Anonymity-set)





**Note:** Visits have an infinite duration - one approach is to add the current date/week to the hash, but this will interfere with active visits during switchover





#### Readme instructions





Update `config/initializers/ahoy.rb` to:





```ruby


class Ahoy::Store < Ahoy::DatabaseStore


  def authenticate(data)


    # do not link visits and users automatically


  end


end





Ahoy.mask_ips = true


Ahoy.cookies = false


```





If you use JavaScript tracking, set:





```js


ahoy.configure({cookies: false});


```





#### Notes





- Encryption: Should already to do this with `config.force_ssl`


- Data deletion: Data is stored in your data store, so already have full control

Une PR qui vise Ã  supprimer les popups de cookies consent pour avoir des screenshots plus propre, lors de l'analyse.


Pour retirer les popups cookies et autre banniÃ¨re GDPR, il n'y a pas d'autres moyens que d'utiliser une extension (https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v3.1.0&show=api-working-with-chrome-extensions). J'ai donc crÃ©Ã© 'cookout' qui supprime ces banniÃ¨res.

Ready for review, but **DO NOT MERGE YET** as this is to be released at the same time as the same dialog on the open source site. That is why this PR is marked as blocked.





## Description


Displays a cookie acceptance dialog if you have not provided an answer in a prior visit. Handles light and dark mode.





## Reviewer Notes


You can play around with this by looking at the Application tab in Chrome's dev tools and clearing out the cookie (`newrelic-gdpr-consent`) or changing its value.

First up, I don't see a banner, initially I took it that I need to implement that myself and simply set `gatsby-gdpr-facebook-pixel` once the user accepts.  So I decided to use `react-cookie-consent` and set this cookie on the `onAccept` event, works to a point but I need to refresh the page for the pixel to load so I tried to send a `window.fbq(""consent"", ""grant"")` but no luck.





So looking through the issues, I see that I should see a banner, I don't, but the further question would be, can I change the appearance of this banner? I can't see anything in the docs/code.


https://github.com/andrezimpel/gatsby-plugin-gdpr-cookies/issues/4#issuecomment-583735299

This PR:





* adds buttons to the settings page to create the privacy or cookie policy pages


* these buttons are built via a helper function [`render_secondary_button`](https://github.com/humanmade/altis-consent/wiki/Altis-Consent-Public-Functions#settingsrender_secondary_button)


* when these buttons are clicked, we hijack the `$_POST` handling to run the logic to create the pages


* the code is based on [how core does it](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-admin/options-privacy.php#L49-L79) but abstracted a bit so we can reuse the same code for both the cookie and privacy policy pages (or other pages that could be added later


* adds a new `cookie-policy.php` which is where the default cookie policy page content is handled


* this policy content is based on [the EU cookie policy content](https://github.com/Really-Simple-Plugins/complianz-gdpr/blob/1ffaff06cbe3c70758f7dd81fc40de257f3d8b0c/config/documents/cookie-policy-eu.php) in the [Complianz](https://github.com/Really-Simple-Plugins/complianz-gdpr) plugin.


* new filters to control various bits of this functionality (all documented in the Filters documentation) including changing the content of the cookie policy page.





A filter exists to disable Gutenberg support for the new cookie policy page that's created which defaults to `true` (Gutenberg enabled)

Cookies were found to have the ""Secure"" flag  set to false. If a cookie is not marked as â€œSecure,â€ it may be transmitted over an insecure connection whether or not the session with the host is secure. In other words, it may be be transmitted over an HTTP connection. If an attacker can intercept a cookie intended to be transmitted over a secure channel, the attacker may be able to get access to secure session tokens or other authentication information.

### Recommendation

It is recommended to enable the ""secure"" flag to instruct the browser to only send the cookie if the request is sent using a secure channel.

More information on this type of vulnerability can be found at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag#Setting_the_Secure_Flag and https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly#Mitigating_the_Most_Common_XSS_attack_using_HttpOnly

There are multiple ways to enable this, one of which is to set it within the
response header:

Set-Cookie: <name>=<value>[; <Max-Age>=<age>]
[; expires=<date>][; domain=<domain_name>]
[; path=<some_path>][; secure][; HttpOnly]

The context table below provides the source and the type of cookie which was found to be vulnerable.

As discussed with Waldemar, ""Google Analytics"" is pre-selected in the cookie settings and hidden when not clicking the ""Manage settings"" button. 


I'm not a GDPR expert, but regarding a [summary of the ""Planet49""-judgement](https://www.oppenhoff.eu/de/news-detail/planet49-urteil-des-bgh-keine-wirksame-einwilligung-zu-cookies-durch-voreingestelltes-opt-in) pre-selected cookies which are not technically required are invalid.


It's stated in the last section under ""Was bedeuten diese Entwicklungen fÃ¼r die Praxis?""





Thus, it would be nice to add the ""checked"" flag as a variable to the mkdocs-config file as part of the cookie consent section, including a minor change of the current config although it is not backward compatible:





```yaml


extra:


  consent:


    cookies:


      analytics:


        checked: true 


        name: Custom name


```





### Use Cases





Changing the config in the described way would also make sure to pre-select individual cookies when further cookies will be added.

This PR modifies our YouTube embed component such that the `src` is only set after the user clicks a button to watch the video. With this, the embedded site has no way of breaking GDPR compliance through cookies, localStorage, or any other API because the site isn't even loaded until the user wants it to be. I assume we'll probably need to add a message like ""By playing this video you accept YouTube's cookies"" to be truly GDPR compliant.

I was first surprised to discover a cookie set by the Website `https://www.filbleu.fr/`


Cookie : `tarteaucitron`


Value : `!facebookpixel=wait!matomo=true!youtube=wait`


Installed via : `https://www.filbleu.fr/typo3conf/ext/tc_theme_site/Resources/Public/Dist/Javascript/vendors/tarteaucitron/tarteaucitron.js`





Cookie Value if the user chooses: '**OK, accept all**' : `!matomo=true!facebookpixel=true!youtube=true`


Cookie Value if the user chhoses '**Deny all cookies**' : `!facebookpixel=false!matomo=false!youtube=false`





This of course is initiated by the Website and I have contacted them to ask in what `facebookpixel` and `youtube` have anything to do with the site, given moreover that there is no connection to 3rd-party sites Facebook nor Youtube, no YouTube embedded video.





The point is : 


1- Many users may believe that denying all cookies will prevent them from logging in, **which is not true** : **refusing blocks only `facebookpixel` and `youtube`**


2- Without GDPR `facebookpixel` and `youtube` would have their cookies (provided 3-rd party cookies are not blocked) : so thank you GDPR


3- Thank you tarteaucitron for perfectly serving GDPR

For a GDPR documentation, I need to specify which cookies our applications creates and which personal user information they may contain.





Right now the application sets:


```


next-auth.session-token.1


next-auth.session-token.0


next-auth.callback-url


next-auth.csrf-token


```





I expect the following:


* `next-auth.session-token.0/1` contain the chunked return value of `callbacks.session` (https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#session-callback)


* `next-auth.callback-url` is just the encrypted callback-url and does not contain any user data


* `next-auth.csrf-token` - not sure. 





All cookie values are encrypted via `NEXT_AUTH_SECRET` as key.





Can I get the raw, decoded values of the cookies to look into them and check where personal user data might get stored?





Thanks!

That very likely means that Typlog's users (i.e., Typlog's customers) are in violation of the GDPR.





I found a reasonable explanation of the issue [here](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/gdpr-cookies/); here's a relevant sampling:





> The GDPR requires a website to only collect personal data from users after they have given their explicit consent to the specific purposes of its use.


>


> Websites must comply with the following GDPR cookie requirements:


>


> * Prior and explicit consent must be obtained before any activation of cookies (apart from whitelisted, necessary cookies).


> ...





California has vaguely similar rules that are described [here](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/what-is-ccpa/).





It's possible that the cookies are just an oversight, and Typlog doesn't actually need them at all. If that's true, they should be removed; there's nothing more to talk about! I suspect, however, that the cookies are needed for the built-in analytics. 





If that's the case, I think there are two broad options.





The first is that Typlog is able to make its analytics cookie-free; in that case, no consent is needed. (I guess? I don't know if there are other subtleties.)





The second is that Typlog isn't able to make its analytics cookie-free; in that case, Typlog would need to introduce a cookie consent mechanism.





Personally, I really, really, really hate cookie consent dialogs. I wouldn't want to use them on my site, so I'd strongly prefer a third option: the ability to turn off features that require them. (I'm specifically focusing on *anonymous* users here.)

We plan to migrate our authentication method from jwt in localstorage to session cookies authentication, in the purpose of api subdomain authentication, instead of front end subdomain authentication.
(one api subdomain can have multiple front end subdomains) .

Ex: 
Api subdomain (owner) :
`https://myclientApiSubdomain1.apidomain.com/`
can have multiple front end subdomains (entity) :  
`https://myClientFrontEndSubdomain1.clientdomain.com/`
`https://myClientFrontEndSubdomain2.clientdomain.com/`

Today, myClientFrontEndSubdomain1 does not share authentication with myClientFrontEndSubdomain2.

It's what we want to do and I know we can do it with session cookies.

Our javascript code is hosted on `https://myclientApiSubdomain1.apidomain.com/client/build/js/app.js`

There are one capacitor app per ""myClientFrontEndSubdomain"" which reference the javascript assets hosted remotely on the api server.


I have read lots of quirks about cookies not sent along http requests from capacitor.

My knownledge of capacitor is small, and my questions are :  

- Is there a way to send cookies along requests, working with our current codebase (axios requests)
- Does it require a specific plugin
- If a plugin is required, does it require specific ios capability(ies), like cookies consent (I believe no as authentication cookies does not require cookies consent in the scope of GDPR) ?

- If not possible, what other options do we have ?",GDPR,GDPR,cookies,cookies,cookies,3

<!-- Please be as descriptive as possible; issues lacking the below details, or for any other reason than to report a bug, may be closed without action. -->





## Prerequisites





<!-- MARK COMPLETED ITEMS WITH AN [x] -->





- [x ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate


- [ x] The issue still exists against the latest `master` branch of WooCommerce on Github (this is **not** the same version as on WordPress.org!)


- [ x] I have attempted to find the simplest possible steps to reproduce the issue


- [ ] I have included a failing test as a pull request (Optional)





## Steps to reproduce the issue





<!-- We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it so please be descriptive! -->





1. Use GET for orders and try to whitelist response fields like (notice attempt to whitelist nested object 'billing_address' fields): https://www.somedomain.com/wc-api/v2/orders?filter[created_at_min]=2018-04-23T08:17:11Z&filter[created_at_max]=2018-04-24T08:17:11Z&fields=id,order_number,created_at,billing_address.first_name,billing_address.last_name,billing_address.email


2. In response observe that our whitelist for nested object 'billing_address' produces only one field. Order of whitelisted fields is not important, always only last mentioned will be returned.


{""orders"":[  


      {  


         ""id"":1624,


         ""order_number"":""1624"",


         ""created_at"":""2018-04-18T09:08:46Z"",


         ""billing_address"":{  


            ""email"":""someemail@test.com""


         }


      }


]}





## Expected/actual behavior





When I follow those steps, I see that in response not all whitelisted fields are returned.





I was expecting to see that when requesting to whitelist fields in nested objects, I would get those fields.





I see that API tries to provide this functionality (https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/46d3638089b58b51a2321b67443b83f409c6b4ec/includes/api/legacy/v2/class-wc-api-resource.php#L320), but fails, because of a problem in code, when the name of the object becomes a key in array and the value is overriden as many times as there are whitelisted fields for that object and only last remains to be whitelisted.





This is important for me, as I want to be GDPR compliant. I know I could just whitelist 'billing_address' field and be done with it, but I want to collect as little data as possible to comply with consent from user, not to mention the benefit of less bandwidth.





## Isolating the problem





<!-- MARK COMPLETED ITEMS WITH AN [x] -->





- [x ] This bug happens with only WooCommerce plugin active


- [ ] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/)


- [ x] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above

However, a client is unable to request a specific set of attributes that should be included into an access token. 





As a consequence, the support of rights versus the support of attributes is unbalanced.





Implicitly, the core draft mandates a bilateral pre-relationship between every pair of AS / RS. This is not advertised in the draft.





Such bilateral pre-relationship limits the scalability of the architecture. When attributes only are supported, no bilateral pre-relationship between an AS and a RS is necessary.





The core document implicitly only allows an AS to add attributes into an access token at its own discretion, without any specific request for them to be included from the client (and hence the end-user).





This means that the core document does not allow an AS to add specific attributes into an access token upon the request from the client (and hence from the end-user).





This has severe consequences in term of the end-user privacy which are not mentioned in the draft.





First of all, since rights are always included, this means that the AS MUST be aware of the identity of the RS. In addition, the AS cannot be kept ignorant of which actions will be performed by a client and on which resources. **_This allows the AS to act as ""Big Brother""._** However, this can be prevented in the case where attributes only are supported.





Secondly, in order to support ""good practices"" (**_User Notice, User Choice, User Consent and Transparency_**) or legislation like the EU GDPR, the end-user should be informed about the set of attributes that are requested by a RS and should also be able to know the treatment(s) that will be done with such attributes. At the moment, a dialogue between the client and the RS is missing. A specific RS end-point should be defined and dedicated for such dialogue.





If the end-user agrees to provide that set of attributes to the RS, he should be able to indicate to the AS which attributes types (and optionally values) should be included into the access token. At the moment, the client is unable to specify to the AS a set of attributes to be included into the access token. In addition, an end-user is even unable to know which set of attributes are known by the AS.





If this situation is going to last, the privacy consideration section should clearly indicate these limitations.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,Lawfulness,Lawfulness,Lawfulness,5

AMP doesn't support that variable. The closest is the [`consentRequired`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-consent/#consentrequired) field. 


`consentRequired` doesn't work well because its value can be true when another regulations applies. Since AMP decided to support IAB TCF, I propose we introduce a new field to the CMP endpoint response ""gdprApplies"". The value will be stored along with the consent string and passed to ad vendors.

Note: AMP will use the ""consentRequired"" value if the ""gdprApplies"" is not defined.

1. On opening the dialog the first time, the initial preferences would not be reflected in the UI


2. Hit 'cancel'


3. On opening the dialog the second time, the initial preferences are now reflected





This was purely a UI bug, and initial preferences were still respected by `analytics.js`. The root of the issue was that the `preferences` object passed to the dialog component on _initialization_ was incorrect, but the object would be corrected on ""Cancel"" or any interaction with the dialog - correcting the issue the 2nd time the dialog was opened.

iOS currently is communicating with SSR articles to implement doesCcpaApply() to effectively render CCPA footer content for US residents.





## Changes





- Added a timeOut delay for async - a delay to allow time for the the data to be parsed and processed to `bridget` before reading the boolean value from `article.ts`


- Added Privacy settings in footer when CCPA not present





NOTE: This was updated from an older PR in order to reduce conflicts

## What does this change?


This change adds CMP-related timers to `EventTimer`, allowing us to send SourcePoint timers to the data lake.





CMP events are not tracked by `EventTimer`'s `trigger` function (see example [here](https://github.com/guardian/consent-management-platform/blob/c404fd68dc629525f4a70e25dfc97fc419a1eb97/src/tcfv2/sourcepoint.ts#L46)), so a static array including CMP event names has been added to to the fields of the `EventTimer` class, as well as a getter function that concatenates `EventTimer`'s private events to the external consent timers.





The tracked events are:


- `cmp-[framework]-init`


-  `cmp-[framework]-got-consent`





where `[framework]` is one of `tcfv2`, `ccpa`, or `aus`. 





Because CMP events are now included in `EventTimer`, no changes are needed to `sendCommercialMetrics`, so we will start seeing these new metrics flow into the lake when this PR is merged.





## Why?


Tracking CMP timers will give us a better understanding of how SP metrics relate to commercial timers.",CCPA,CCPA,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

## What does this change?


This is a fix for the failing ccpa tests. The __uspapi.getUSPData function, in the source point sdk, no longer returns a consistent 'gpcEnabled' property to test. However, the GPC signal is respected when testing manually. This update tests whether the banner is shown or hidden when the gcp header, 'Sec-GPC' is set to 0 or 1.

This removes the broken (and unnecessary) monitoring for setting the Sec-gpc header value to 0.


Added linting fixes too.





## Why?


The ccpa monitoring started breaking for the method that sets the Sec-gpc header to 0 and checks the banner appears after the last Sourcepoint release.  On investigation the value should only ever be 1 to turn the GPC Signal on for the user - but non-existent if it's off.

Resolves https://github.com/dust-tt/dust/issues/3351.

This PR fulfills the necessary steps to make our Dust App available within the Atlassian community, enabling everyone to link their Confluence (and soon Jira) accounts with Dust. As part of the app-sharing prerequisites, we must adhere to Atlassian's GDPR guidelines (see [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/user-privacy-developer-guide/#user-privacy-guide-for-app-developers)).

The specified endpoint, `/app/report-accounts`, takes a list of user account IDs and their oldest updated times and determines whether we can retain those accounts' data in our infrastructure. If an account is deactivated, we are required to purge all its associated data. This account status check must be conducted every 7 days.

To comply with the 7-day cycle, this PR introduces a Temporal schedule. This schedule will trigger a routine to verify the status of all user accounts. Additionally, we will implement checks in production to guarantee the proper execution of this schedule.

### Current Behavior

Crash during:

### Expected Behavior

No crash during:

`AppLovinMAX.initialize(""key"");`

### How to Reproduce

Unfortunately, I can't reproduce it on my end. The crash reports are from Crashlytics. It does happen to a small fraction of users about 100 a day.

One interesting observation is that almost all users experiencing this bug have not granted the GDPR consent. I use `ConsentForm.loadConsentForm()` to get the users consent like described here [Admob Documentation](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/eu-consent) After the consent is observed Applovin is initialised via `AppLovinMAX.initialize(""key"")`.

Suite Ã  de rÃ©centes modifications sur le sujet, on remonte dÃ©sormais uniquement la derniÃ¨re session **publiÃ©e** d'un Ã©lÃ¨ve Ã  une certification (plutÃ´t que toutes, Ã©liminant ainsi les doublons).
Cela a introduit une rÃ©gression : au cours d'une annÃ©e un Ã©lÃ¨ve est parfois inscrit Ã  plusieurs sessions, mais s'il rÃ©ussit la premiÃ¨re de l'annÃ©e il ne va pas forcÃ¨ment en rattrapage. Mais le rattrapage reste publiÃ©.
Il faut donc prendre en compte la derniÃ¨re session publiÃ©e certes, mais Ã  laquelle le candidat est **entrÃ© en certification**
A noter que l'on veut l'Ã©tat actuel, c'est Ã  dire que si un Ã©lÃ¨ve est entrÃ© plusieurs fois en certification, c'est bien la derniÃ¨re entrÃ©e en certification que l'on veut.

## :robot: Proposition

* Limiter la remontÃ©e des identifiants de candidats au candidats qui sont rentrÃ©s en certification.

## :rainbow: Remarques

âš ï¸ Pour des raisons de GDPR, on part aussi uniquement des donnÃ©es de certification, et on Ã©vite de passer par la table qui donne beaucoup d'informations personnelles d'un candidat. Cela pour prÃ©parer le terrain Ã  terme d'une sÃ©paration encore plus forte Ã  venir de ces donnÃ©es du reste des donnÃ©es.

## :100: Pour tester

* CrÃ©er 4 sessions SCO avec `certif-sco@example.net`, y inscrire dans toutes ces sessions **un mÃªme Ã©lÃ¨ve** (mÃªme organization-learner)
* Faire rentre dans la session 1 le candidat, passer la session, rÃ©ussir la certification, finaliser et publier la session
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des rÃ©sultats, y constater la certification **validÃ©e** pour l'Ã©lÃ¨ve
* Lancer la session numÃ©ro 2, faire passer le mÃªme Ã©lÃ¨ve, et terminer vite son test (qu'importe son statut, faites le Ã©chouer, au pire vous le rejeterez pour fraude), finaliser et publier la session
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des rÃ©sultats, y constater la certification **rejetÃ©e** pour l'Ã©lÃ¨ve
* Lancer la session numÃ©ro 3, **ne pas faire entrer le candidat en session**, finaliser et publier la session
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des rÃ©sultats, y constater la certification **rejetÃ©e** pour l'Ã©lÃ¨ve (le rÃ©sultat numÃ©ro 2)
* Lancer la session numÃ©ro 4, faire rentrer le candidat en session, rÃ©ussir la certification, finaliser  **mais ne publiez pas** la session
  * Cas particulier, on a  donc un candidat, avec un rÃ©sultat, mais pas encore publiÃ©
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des rÃ©sultats, y constater la certification **rejetÃ©e** pour l'Ã©lÃ¨ve (le rÃ©sultat numÃ©ro 2)

- Refactor lesson to comply with style guide
- Rewrite GDPR information to be more neutral
- Adds some new links as assignments and additional resources.
- Add a link back to the more text lesson in the admin dashboard project

We are proposing two significant updates to our email system: firstly, to refactor our current resend notification templates using React-email components for better maintainability and scalability, and secondly, to implement a welcome email feature that automatically triggers when a new user signs up.

## Current Implementation
Our current email templates, including resend notifications, utilize inline CSS styles within standard React components. This approach has limitations in email client compatibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Changes
1. **Refactor Email Templates**: Transition our existing email templates to utilize React-email components, ensuring improved compatibility across email clients and easier maintenance.
2. **Implement Welcome Email**: Develop and integrate an automatic welcome email to enhance user engagement immediately upon registration.

## Objectives
- Improve email client compatibility and maintainability of our email templates.
- Enhance user experience and engagement through immediate communication post-registration.
## Requirements
- **Refactoring**:
  - Integrate the React-email library.
  - Rewrite existing templates to use React-email components.
- **Welcome Email**:
  - Design and develop content that aligns with our brand and is responsive across devices.
  - Automate the email dispatch upon user registration.

## Tasks
1. **Evaluate and Integrate React-email Library**: Incorporate the library into our project for building email templates.
2. **Redesign Email Templates**: Use React-email components to rewrite the resend notification and develop the welcome email template.
3. **Develop Email Content**: Ensure the content for both emails is engaging, informative, and brand-consistent.
4. **Automate Email Dispatch**: Integrate email sending functionality into the registration workflow.
5. **Testing and Compatibility Checks**: Test email rendering across different email clients like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.
6. **Update Documentation**: Reflect changes in the email development process and setup in our project documentation.
7. **Monitor Performance**: Track open rates and user feedback for the welcome email to gauge its effectiveness.

## Expected Outcomes
- By using React-email components, we anticipate reduced overhead in maintaining email styles and enhanced reliability across various platforms.
- The welcome email is expected to increase user satisfaction and engagement, potentially reducing churn and fostering platform adoption.

## Additional Resources
- React-email documentation: [Link to React-email documentation]
- Example implementations or guides for email template development and user engagement strategies.

## Risks and Challenges
- Ensure seamless integration of React-email without impacting current email functionalities.
- Compliance with GDPR, CAN-SPAM Act, and other relevant legal standards.
- Conduct A/B testing to optimize the email impact based on analytics and user feedback.

Combining these issues into a cohesive project allows for streamlined development and testing, ensuring consistency across our email communications and enhancing overall user experience.",CCPA,CCPA,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

Currently VIVO uses the Google Fonts API. And although a legal complaint campaign about this failed in Austria not too long ago, it can be assumed that this is not GDPR-compliant. If I see this correctly, the only compliant solution would be to host the fonts locally.

 - Uses [NiiVue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue) for loading and visualization. This allows drag and drop support for voxel formats including [NIfTI](https://brainder.org/2012/09/23/the-nifti-file-format/), [NRRD](http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html), [MRtrix MIF](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/image_data.html#mrtrix-image-formats), [AFNI HEAD/BRIK](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/README.attributes.html), [MGH/MGZ](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/MghFormat), [ITK MHD](https://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/MetaIO/Documentation#Reading_a_Brick-of-Bytes_.28an_N-Dimensional_volume_in_a_single_file.29), [ECAT7](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/tree/28aae3fab22309047d36d867c624cd629c921ca6/ecat_validation/ecat_info) as well as limited DICOM support.
 - Allows models to be run either on the main thread (as before) or a web worker. In theory, web workers allow more interactive main threads, and are faster as delays are not required and there are no concurrent tasks. In practice, both methods play a role: [Safari does not yet support TFJS web workers](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/8267) and in practice web workers appear to have fewer resources (e.g. heap memory). 
 - Allows classifications to be edited by drawing to append or erase voxels.
 - Allows entires scenes (images, classification results, contrast, crosshair position, drawings) to be saved as NiiVue documents that can be opened anywhere.
 - Removes all Python dependencies (pyodide) and replaces these functions with native JavaScript.
 - Replaces Papaya and ThreeJS dependencies with NiiVue.
 - Dramatically reduces peak heap memory usage (for low memory 104 region model the reduction is x173).
 - Reduces static memory usage.
 - Numerous optimizations increase performance.

To do:
 - Once accepted, a few parts of the [wiki should be updated](https://github.com/neuroneural/brainchop/wiki/Local-Setup).
 - All current bitmap art (e.g. `Input3DEnhancements.gif`) show the older user interface, and these should be updated.
 - Currently allows user to send diagnostics rather than automatic telemetry. From some perspectives, this is a limitation. brainchop team should consider the ideal mechanism as well as [GDPR compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).

## Commit message

[FEATURE] Add record list download presets

The modal to download selected data from a record listing
(Web > List) is enhanced to display a list of configured
presets.

These presets can be defined via page TSconfig or user
TSconfig. The listed columns take personal ""exclude
fields"" into consideration.

A preset definition looks like:

```
mod.web_list.downloadPresets {
    pages {
        10 {
            label = Test-Preset-1
            columns = uid, title, crdate, slug
        }

        20 {
            label = LLL:EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf:preset2.label
            columns = uid, title, slug
            identifier = some-identifier
        }
    }
}
```

Multiple presets for one table can exist, and as many
presets for as many tables as needed are possible.

Extensions can provide such preset definitions in their
`Configuration/page.tsconfig` file, or in Site Sets.

A new PSR-14 event `BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent`
allows to modify the list of presets as well.

A new PSR-14 event `BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent` allows
to modify the actual download data, replacing the old
hook usage of $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']
['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']
['customizeCsvHeader'] and $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']
['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']
['customizeCsvRow'].

These hooks have been deprecated and are scheduled for
removal with TYPO3 v14; the only public TYPO3
extension currently utilizing this hook is gridelements.

==========================================================
Deprecation: #103785 - Deprecate hooks for record download
==========================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

The previously used hooks
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
and
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`,
used to manipulate the download / export configuration of records, triggered
in the :guilabel:`Web > List` backend module, have been deprecated in favor of a
new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent`.

Details for migration and functionality can be found in :ref:`feature-102337-1715591178`

Impact
======

When the hook :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
or
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`
is executed, this will trigger a PHP deprecation warning.

The extension scanner will find possible usages with a weak match.

Affected installations
======================

All installations using
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
or
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`
are affected.


Migration
=========

The new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent`
can be used as a near drop-in replacement.

=====================================================================
Feature: #102337 - PSR-14 event for modifying record list export data
=====================================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

A new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent`
has been introduced to modify the result of a download / export initiated via
the :guilabel:`Web > List` module.

This replaces the
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
and
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`,
hooks, which have been :ref:`deprecated <deprecation-102337-1715591179>`.

The event allows to modify both body and header section of the data
dump, so it can e.g. be use to redact sepcific data for GDPR compliance,
transform / translate specific data, trigger creation of archives or web hooks,
log export access and more.

The event offers the following methods:

- :php:`getHeaderRow()`: Return the current header row of the dataset.
- :php:`setHeaderRow()`: Sets the modified header row of the dataset.
- :php:`getRecords()`: Returns the current body rows of the dataset.
- :php:`setRecords()`: Sets the modified body rows of the dataset.
- :php:`getRequest()`: Returns the PSR request context.
- :php:`getTable()`: Returns the name of the database table of the dataset.
- :php:`getFormat()`: Returns the the format of the download action (CSV/JSON).
- :php:`getFilename()`: Returns the name of the download filename (for browser output).
- :php:`getId()`: Returns the page UID of the download origin.
- :php:`getModTSconfig()`: Returns the active module TSconfig of the download origin.
- :php:`getColumnsToRender()`: Returns the list of header columns for the triggered download.
- :php:`isHideTranslations()`: Returns whether translations are hidden or not.

Example
=======

The corresponding event listener class:

..  code-block:: php

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace Vendor\MyPackage\Core\EventListener;

    use TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Attribute\AsEventListener;

    #[AsEventListener(identifier: 'my-package/record-list-download-data')]
    final readonly class DataListener
    {
        public function __invoke(BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent $event): void
        {
            // List of redactable fields.
            $gdprFields = ['title', 'author'];

            $headerRow = $event->getHeaderRow();
            $records = $event->getRecords();

            // Iterate header to mark redacted fields...
            foreach ($headerRow as $headerRowKey => $headerRowValue) {
                if (in_array($headerRowKey, $gdprFields, true)) {
                    $headerRow[$headerRowKey] .= ' (REDACTED)';
                }
            }

            // Redact actual content...
            foreach ($records as $uid => $record) {
                foreach ($gdprFields as $gdprField) {
                    if (isset($record[$gdprField])) {
                        $records[$uid][$gdprField] = '(REDACTED)';
                    }
                }
            }

            $event->setHeaderRow($headerRow);
            $event->setRecords($records);
        }
    }

Migration
=========

The functionality of both hooks (:php:`customizeCsvHeader` and
:php:`customizeCsvRow`) is now handled by the new PSR-14 event.

Migrating :php:`customizeCsvHeader`
-----------------------------------

The prior hook parameter/variable :php:`fields` is now available via
:php:`$event->getColumnsToRender()`. The actual record data
(previously :php:`$this->recordList`, submitted to the hook as its object
reference) is accessible via :php:`$event->getHeaderRow()`.

Migrating :php:`customizeCsvRow`
--------------------------------

The following prior hook parameters/variables have these substitutes:

- :php:`databaseRow` is now available via :php:`$event->getRecords()` (see note below).
- :php:`tableName` is now available via :php:`$event->getTable()`.
- :php:`pageId` is now available via :php:`$event->getId()`.

The actual record data
(previously :php:`$this->recordList`, submitted to the hook as its object
reference) is accessible via :php:`$event->getRecords()`.

Please note that the hook was previously executed once per row retrieved
from the database. The PSR-14 event however - due to performance reasons -
is only executed for the full record list after database retrieval,
thus allows post-processing on this whole dataset.

Impact
======

Using the PSR-14 event :php:`BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent` it's
now possible to modify all of the data available when downloading / exporting
a list of records via the :guilabel:`Web > List` module.

==========================================================================
Feature: #102337 - PSR-14 event for modifying record list download presets
==========================================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

A new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent`
has been introduced to manipulate the list of available download presets in
the :guilabel:`Web > List` module.

See :ref:`feature-102337-1712597691` for a detailed description of how to
utilize presets when downloading a set of records from the backend in CSV
or JSON format.

The event class offers the following methods:

- :php:`getPresets()`: Returns list of presets set via TSconfig
- :php:`setPresets()`: Sets a modified list of presets.
- :php:`getDatabaseTable()`: Returns the database table name that a preset applies to.
- :php:`getRequest()`: Returns the PSR Request object for the context of the request.
- :php:`getId()`: Returns the page ID of the originating page.

Note that the event is dispatched for one specific database table name. If
an event listener is created to attach presets to different tables, the
listener method must check for the table name, as shown in the example below.

If no download presets exist for a given table, the PSR-14 event can still
be used to modify and add presets to it via the :php:`setPresets()` method.

The array passed from :php:`getPresets()` to :php:`setPresets()` can contain
an array collection of :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\DownloadPreset`
objects with the array key using the preset label.
The existing presets can be retrieved with those getters:

- :php:`$preset->getLabel()`: Name of the preset (can utilize LLL translations), optional.
- :php:`$preset->getColumns()`: Array of database table column names.
- :php:`$preset->getIdentifier()`: Identifier of the preset (manually set or calculated based on label and columns)

The event listener can also remove array indexes, or also columns of existing
array entries by passing a newly constructed :php:`DownloadPreset` object with the
changed `label` and `columns` constructor properties.

Example
=======

The corresponding event listener class:

..  code-block:: php

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace Vendor\MyPackage\RecordList\EventListener;

    use TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\DownloadPreset;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Attribute\AsEventListener;

    #[AsEventListener(identifier: 'my-package/modify-record-list-preset')]
    final readonly class PresetListener
    {
        public function __invoke(BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent $event): void
        {
            $presets = $event->getPresets();

            switch ($event->getDatabaseTable()) {
                case 'be_users':
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('PSR-14 preset', ['uid','email']);
                    break;

                case 'pages':
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('PSR-14 preset', ['title']);
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('Another PSR-14 preset', ['title', 'doktype']);
                    break;

                case 'tx_myvendor_myextension':
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('PSR-14 preset', ['uid', 'something']);
                    break;
            }

            $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('Available everywhere, simple UID list', ['uid']);

            $presets['some-identifier'] = new DownloadPreset('Overwrite preset', ['uid, pid'], 'some-identifier');

            $event->setPresets($presets);
        }
    }

Impact
======

Using the PSR-14 event :php:`BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent`
it's now possible to modify the available presets of each table for
downloading / exporting a list of such records via the :guilabel:`Web > List`
module.

=======================================================
Feature: #102337 - Presets for download of record lists
=======================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

In the :guilabel:`Web > List` backend module, the data of records for each
database table (including pages and content records) can be downloaded.

This export takes the current selected list of columns into consideration and
alternatively allows to choose all columns.

A new feature has been introduced, adding the ability to pick the exported
data columns from a list of configurable presets.

Those presets can be configured via page TSconfig, and can also be
overridden via user TSconfig (for example, to expand certain presets
only to specific users).

..  code-block:: typoscript
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/page.tsconfig

    mod.web_list.downloadPresets {
        pages {
            10 {
                label = Quick overview
                columns = uid, title, crdate, slug
            }

            20 {
                identifier = LLL:EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf:preset2.label
                label = UID and titles only
                columns = uid, title
            }
        }
    }

Each entry of :typoscript:`mod.web_list.downloadPresets`
defines the table name on the first level (in this case `pages`), followed by
any number of presets.

Each preset contains a :typoscript:`label` (the displayed name of the preset,
which can be a locallang key), a comma-separated list of each column that
should be included in the export as :typoscript:`columns` and optionally
a :typoscript:`identifier`. In case :typoscript:`identifier` is not provided,
the identifier is generated as hash of the :typoscript:`label` and
:typoscript:`columns`.

This can be manipulated with user TSConfig by adding the :typoscript:`page.`
prefix. User TSConfig is loaded after page TSConfig, so you can overwrite
existing keys or replace the whole list of keys:

..  code-block:: typoscript
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/user.tsconfig

    page.mod.web_list.downloadPresets {
        pages {
            10 {
                label = Quick overview (customized)
                columns = uid, title, crdate, slug
            }

            30 {
                label = Short with URL
                columns = uid, title, slug
            }
        }
    }

Since any table can be configured for a preset, any extension
can deliver a defined set of presets through the
:file:`EXT:my_extension/Configuration/page.tsconfig` file and
their table name(s).

Additionally, the list of presets can be manipulated via the new
:ref:`BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent <feature-102337-1715591177>`.

Impact
======

Editors can now export data with specific presets that match their need
as identified by the website maintainer or extension developer(s).

It is no longer required to pick specific columns to export over and over again,
and the list of presets is controlled by the website maintainer.

Two new PSR-14 Events have been added to allow further manipulation:

*  :ref:`BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent <feature-102337-1715591177>`
*  :ref:`BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent <feature-102337-1715591178>`

As a contributor, I have found the lack of clear and comprehensive privacy policies somewhat frustrating. In today's digital age, where data security and privacy are paramount, not knowing how my personal information is being used or protected creates a sense of unease. This uncertainty can deter potential contributors from engaging fully, thereby limiting the community's growth and vibrancy.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
To address this concern, I respectfully suggest the implementation of more transparent and stringent privacy policies. This could include:

Detailed Privacy Policy: A clearly articulated privacy policy that explains how user data is collected, used, stored, and protected.
User Consent Mechanisms: Ensure that users explicitly consent to data collection and usage practices through opt-in mechanisms.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
 a user-friendly privacy dashboard where contributors can manage their data preferences and see what information is being stored.

**Additional context**
The need for enhanced privacy measures is underscored by the increasing number of data breaches and the growing concern among users about their digital footprint. Implementing robust privacy measures not only protects user data but also builds trust and loyalty, encouraging more active participation and contribution to the platform. It aligns with global standards and regulations such as GDPR, reinforcing the platform's credibility and commitment to user security.",CCPA,CCPA,N/A,acountability,N/A,0

Need to update the link about the data protection act from the T&Cs in connect - it currently links out to the [legislation.gov.uk](http://legislation.gov.uk/) page which is not best practice. Will link to easier to understand [gov.uk](http://gov.uk/) content.

**Type**:


 


**Reference (Include section and paragraph number)**:


1.2


3.2.1.5


 


**Comment (Include rationale for comment)**:


The report states in sectiuon 1.2: ""While the schema in this document is intended to demonstrate the value of attribute metadata in supporting U.S. Federal Government use cases, the ideal metadata schema could be used in both commercial and public sector implementations, thus serving as a foundation to enable greater federation across markets and sectors. ""


However the description/definition of classification-metadata is written to accomodate Federal Government use cases.


 


**Suggested Change**:


Classification: ""The regulatory classification level of the attribute.""


For example, in the European Union, different regulations will apply to personal data such as the GDPR. In the Attribute metadata ""Allowed Values"", it can be made specific which regulatory classifications are applicable.





Probably the Releasability can be gneralised as well.





Another consideration would be if the classification-metadata is really attribute VALUE metadata or attribute metadata (on schema level).

To ensure protection of sensitive data, a few partners are asking for a functionality to set passwords on publicly shared dashboards. It's also in line with GDPR legislation that we need to help partners protect their sensitive data.





# Problem or idea





When a dashboard is shared publicly via the 'share' option, anyone who obtains the link can view it. That is not safe enough as some survey data might contain personal data of respondents like religion, sexual orientation etc. If this data (or visualisations) that can identify certain people or communities gets into the wrong hands, the respondents might be in danger or persecution. There are other cases of possible dashboard data mishandling too. 





# Solution or next step


Currently, the dashboard sharing window looks like that:

It should be enhanced with password setting functionality.

**Current situation**


Collected data and media are located in public folder and user and other apps can easily access them. The reason it is like this the ability to manually upload to flow the exported files. The user connect the device to the PC, browsers the device's filesystem and copies those files to the PC. She then uploads them via the dashboard.





**GDPR Compliant solution**


The collected files and media (images, videos...) will be kept in the app internal private storage by defaults. Only our app can access those files. If the user wants to export the files manually, shell will have to enable the export of these files to the public folder. 





**Sharing options**


1) Enable the the exporting of files once for all the surveys? In that case, we can have an entry inside settings which will enable this once and all the existing and future files will be public. 


2) Add a ""share"" entry to navigation drawer and then each time user presses it we will share/export all the existing collected data.


3) Add a ""share"" entry to navigation drawer which would display a list of all the existing files and user can select with a checkbox which ones she want to export.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

The actual behaviour is a privacy issue and may force us to stop offering the service when the EU GDPR is applicable after 25th of May 2018.





### Steps to reproduce


1. Create an E-Mail message


2. Enter a few letters for the recipient





### Expected behaviour


Show recipients only from the user's address book he/she has access to (if address book app is available for that user), else show no proposal for a recipient. This restriction should be configurable as an option in the config.php for sites, which offers a nextcloud service outside organisational boundaries.





### Actual behaviour


Matching names from the total user base is shown. Any user can read any E-Mail address. 





### Mail app

It's not consistent across the board, but here is an example from moniker.com: https://faq.moniker.com/my-account/european-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr





Currently aws-web-stacks tells AWS to validate the requested domain using 'email validation'. AWS sends the email an email to 5 specified accounts at the domain in question (like 'admin', 'webmaster', etc) and then also to the 3 emails listed as the Registrant, Technical, and Administrative contact in WHOIS. Those last 3 will no longer be available if the registrar is now hiding them. If you happen to have mail set up for the domain, then you're OK because one of the first 5 accounts should receive the email.





If not, however, the email will never get to you, cert approval will fail, and the stack will get rolled back. For subdomains like foo.example.com, you're probably not going to want to set up a MX record for each subdomain.

### URL(s) where the issue occurs





Any wapo url apart from the homepage, e.g. `https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-fires-back-at-us-tariffs-vows-to-defend-its-core-interests/2018/07/06/f42fc812-8091-11e8-a63f-7b5d2aba7ac5_story.html`, after you've viewed 5 pages.





### Describe the issue





A paywall box appears on the screen, and the URL in the address bar is changed to the homepage. Zapping the element doesn't work, as the article has been truncated. If you hit ESC at the right time (just before the address changes), you can stop the paywall activating without having to use an incognito window.





### Screenshot(s)

- uBlock Origin version: Nano Adblocker 1.0.0.55, Nano Defender 15.0.0.5





### Settings





- None





### Notes





Using an incognito window is annoying because you have to go through the GDPR warning again, and it only lasts for 5 pages before you need to close the window and start again. Hitting ESC before the address changes will stop the paywall and allow you to read the article, but the timing is very tight and comments can't be read on the article. I wonder if it's possible to have the paywall script stopped as a matter of course in Nano Defender? Thanks.





EDIT: I found this: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/38567-washington-post-paywall-bypass - it works as a temporary stopgap but it means I need TamperMonkey running.

https://www.kunena.org/forum/general-questions-and-how-tos/153355-social-share-buttons





**To Reproduce**


Steps to reproduce the behavior:


1. Choose in the template setting Display Social Share = Yes


2. Visit your Forum as guest





**Expected behavior**


Social Share should be available





**Actual result**


Guests can't see the buttons





**Additional context**


But when we make Social Share available to guests, then makes the profile setting ""Social Share - Yes or No"" no sense.


As soon as a member log out, the Social Share buttons are back, also if in their profile is set ""Social Share - No"".


My opinion, it is the task of the website operator to inform his users about privacy (GDPR)  and to define if there are Social Share on his website or not.

https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/8908,367527482.00000000000,1,0,0,N/A,N/A,Login disable - why is it there and why is it an endless 403 loop with no information?,"Currently Mastodon supports ""Login Disabled"" sort of suspension:


> A Mastodon account can be disabled. This prevents the user from doing anything with the account, but all of the content is still there untouched. This limitation is reversible, the account can be re-enabled at any time. This limitation is only available for local users on your server.





https://docs.joinmastodon.org/usage/moderation/#disable-login





And it's all sorts of wrong:





1. When this suspension is applied to the user they cannot log out. 


They will see 403 unless they clear session cookies manually.  


2. If user manages to log back in they will be stuck in 403 again, untill sessions cookies are cleared manually.  


3. There's no indication what's going on.


4. User is not able to delete or export their data or access any other settings such as redirect account etc.  





Why is this feature even here? It's clear abuse of power and forced data retention which as I've pointed out in a previous issue is GDPR incompliant https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/8760

I've also updated the minimum version of Moodle the plugin will work with, as the privacy implementation uses PHP 7 style type hinting. We can also use the legacy polyfil if required, but it is better to be moving forward.





I added the null provider privacy class to the plugin. This means that the plugin doesn't store user information. This was a tough call. From my understanding of the plugin, even though the plugin is very flexible it won't store user data. As plugin configuration generally doesn't either. The settings defined in this plugin may cause the plugin it is extending to store data, but this is the responsibility of that plugin.





We can always change this approach in the future",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

    SO - This is intended to a measure of quality and how test automation.


    JA  - Is this for all projects, rather than just WIS1.


    SO -Yes.


    DW - Yes this could be used beyond WIS1, a generic approach. Suggested that we look at other projects and feedback.


    WQ - We have some automated testing in the CI process. But not clear how it fits with WIS1 e


    DW - I donâ€™t we should be specific to WIS1 as this is the only criteria we have now and the Association will consider other projects. A generic statement would be good.


    SO - It would be good if its applies to WIS1 and can evolve


    DW - It would be good to keep this one and see what applies to WIS2 when more information on WIS2 is available.


    WQ - Keep WIS1 is maintenance mode. So should not be concerned with test metrics and review if there is a major issue.  The next round of GIS audits are being worked on but no detail yet.

          participate actively in PMCs.  Could not see someone obvious could 


          fulfil this.  So concluded that this would be worked up collectively at  


          each PMC and action taken by a number of individuals, appropriate.

## Description


We are using the tool Codified Security to find out the security issues in the signed apk and we are getting the following security issues:





**1. App creates a temp file :**


You need to fix this because:





Sensitive data might be written into a temp file.


You can fix this by changing this in your code.





Avoid creating temp files.


Common Weakness Enumeration





CWE-295 â€” The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a


certificate.





Problem has been found in:


com/facebook/cache/disk/DefaultDiskStorage.java


`try {


paramString = new InserterImpl(paramString, paramObject.createTempFile(localFile));


        return paramString;


      localStringBuilder.append(resourceId); localStringBuilder.append(""."");


return File.createTempFile(localStringBuilder.toString(),


   "".tmp"", paramFile);


      }`

com/google/android/gms/common/data/BitmapTeleporter.java


`try {


  localFile = File.createTempFile(""teleporter"", "".tmp"", zali);


}`





**2. TCP socket usage detected**





**You need to fix this because:**


TCP sockets need to be encrypted otherwise it may be vulnerable to the following attack mechanisms: DoS attacks, replay attacks, man in the middle (MITM) attacks, eavesdropping and subsequent impersonation. It's highly recommended to use TLS or other methods to secure your connection.


 **Common Weakness Enumeration**


CWE-941 â€” The software creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

This issue relates to the page:


""<url>/civicrm/gdpr/comms-prefs/update""





## Expected Behaviour


- Updating ""Email"" / ""Post"" should reflect the values set on the Contact in CiviCRM (either ""Yes"" or ""No"")





## Current Behaviour


- The select input boxes for ""Email"" and ""Post"" always default to ""Yes""





## Steps to Reproduce


I believe this is a User Interface bug on the URL this issue relates to. There are additional screenshots below.


1. Visit ""<url>/civicrm/gdpr/comms-prefs/update""


2. Update ""Email"" and/or ""Post"" to ""No""

`vault_batch_encrypt` and `vault_batch_decrypt` work correctly when some of the values are present, but not if the array contains only blank values.





If all the values are blank, we send an empty array to Vault, which returns ```missing batch input to process```


Solution is not to do any calls, when all values are blank and simply return them as they are.

https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/29253,388785719.00000000000,1,0,0,N/A,N/A,"Analytics: initial implementation of top level Registration, Signup, AddToCart, Purchase event handling functions","#### Changes





- Implements initial version of Registration, Signup, AddToCart and Purchase events handling functions by exporting them directly from the `analytics` object and removing the requirement to resort to including `ad-tracking` all over Calypso.


- Attempts to make the above as coherent as possible across Google Analytics, Google Ads (via Gtag), Facebook, Bing.


- Removed Donuts tracking.





This PR focuses on having the main networks above connected to the ""Signup"" and ""Purchase"" events. In subsequent PRs we'll complete the coverage of all events across all the main and secondary networks.





**Testing Setup**





- Make sure you have the following features enabled in:


  - `development.json`: `gdpr-banner`, `google-analytics`, `ad-tracking` 


  - or via the URL params in the calypso.live URL: https://calypso.live/?branch=add/google-ads-gtag-cleanup (`?flags=gdpr-banner,google-analytics,ad-tracking`)





- Enable debug logs by entering the following in your browser console:


```


localStorage.setItem( 'debug', 'calypso:analytics:*' );


```


- Set the following to ensure the GDPR logic does not block the trackers:


```


document.cookie = 'sensitive_pixel_option=yes;'


```





- Reload Calypso and make sure you see `isAdTrackingAllowed: true` through out the test in the JS console.





- Make sure to select the options ""Preserve Logs"" in both Chrome's JS console and Network tab.





**Testing ""Registration"" and ""Signup"" Events**





- Point your Calypso to `/start/user`


- Create a new WordPress.com testing account


- In Chrome's Network tab filter by `calypso_user_registration_complete`: you should see two entries, one for Tracks (`pixel.wp.com`) and one for Google Analytics (`google-analytics.com`).


- Note: at the moment there are no marketing trackers bound to this event yet, ie, no Facebook, Google Ads etc.





- Select a free domain


- Select a paid plan 


- Filter the Network tab by the following to inspect we fired the Signup event on every network:


  - `calypso_signup_complete` --> Tracks (`http://pixel.wp.com/t.gif[...]` entry)


  - `calypso_signup_complete` --> Google Analytics (www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Signup&ea=calypso_signup_complete:is_new_user,is_new_site,has_cart_items[...])


  - `zKK-CKPG7ocBENbl8_wD` --> AdWords


  - `5-NnCKy3xZQBEP6YlcMD` --> Google Ads Gtag


  - `ec=signup` --> Bing (`bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=4074038[...]`)


  - `ev=Subscribe&` --> Facebook


  - `signu1` --> Floodlight (`6355556.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;dc_pre=CKKP9aW-rOACFUzD3god3OACkA;type=wordp0;cat=signu1;ord=1;[...]`)


- By this point you should have been redirected to a log-in page and received an email to activate your account.


- You can activate your email copying the link in the incognito window that you used to launch your Calypso instance.


- Once verified head to `/log-in` and enter the newly created account credentials.


- Double check that so far there are no suspect JS errors.


- You should have the previously selected plan in your cart.





**Testing ""AddToCart"" Events**





- Add a paid plan to the cart for a test site without finalizing the payment.


- Filter by the following in Chrome's Network tab to check we fire the event on the various networks:


  - `calypso_cart_product_add` --> Tracks (`pixel.wp.com/t.gif?[...]_en=calypso_cart_product_add[...]`)


  - `calypso_cart_product_add` --> Google Analytics (`www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Checkout&ea=calypso_cart_product_add[...]`)


  - `AddToCart` --> Facebook (`www.facebook.com/tr/?id=823166884443641&ev=AddToCart&[...]`)





**Testing ""Purchase"" Events**





- Finalize the purchase of the plan using free credits


- Filter by the following in Chrome's Network tab to check we fire the event on the various networks:


  - `calypso_checkout_payment_success` --> Tracks (`pixel.wp.com/t.gif?[...]_en=calypso_checkout_payment_success[...]`)


  - `calypso_checkout_payment_success` --> Google Analytics (`www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Purchase&ea=calypso_checkout_payment_success[...]`)


  - `taG8CPW8spQBEP6YlcMD` --> Google Ads Gtag


  - `type=wpsal0;cat=purch0` --> Floodlight WPCom (`6355556.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;dc_pre=CKbTs9zwrOACFUe0UQodDtQNZQ;type=wpsal0;cat=purch0[...]`)


  - `type=wpsal0;cat=wpsale` --> Floodlight Legacy (`6355556.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;dc_pre=CKbTs9zwrOACFUe0UQodDtQNZQ;type=wpsal0;cat=wpsale[...]`)


  - `ev=Purchase` -> Facebook (`www.facebook.com/tr/?id=823166884443641&ev=Purchase&[...]`)


  - `app_id=653793` --> Nanigans (`api.nanigans.com/event.php[...]`)


  - `ec=purchase` --> Bing (`bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=4074038[...]`)


  - `tags.w55c.net/rs?id=d299eef42f2d4135a96d0d40ace66f3a&t=checkout` --> Icon Media


  - `_fp.event.Purchase` --> Quantcast (`pixel.quantserve.com/pixel;[...]labels=_fp.event.Purchase%20Confirmation%2C_fp.pcat.[...]`)





**Test Free Signups**


- Create a new test account this time by choosing both a free domain and a free plan.


- Once created your Network tab should show the following entry for Google Analytics:


  - Filter by: `calypso_signup_complete:is_new_user,is_new_site` --> `https://www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Signup&ea=calypso_signup_complete%3Ais_new_user%2Cis_new_site[...]`

At the very least you will need to implement the external_link functions of the privacy api to disclose that you pass private user information to an external service.





Sites that use continuous integration processes will not be able to use your plugin because Moodle runs unit tests which check to see if all extra plugins include the privacy class.

We now have to obey the law and comply with GDPR, ensuring people's data are securely stored, we track who has access to it and if the client requests to review, update or remove their data, we should do so in an automated fashion. But, are you there yet? Chances are, there's still a long way to go.





In this talk I will address some of the challenges we solved in greenfield projects as well in old, legacy applications. We introduced ""privacy by design"" as just another ""by design"" mantra we already had build in our workflow and as we worked on the project, we applied it everywhere when we saw user data (personal or not) was processed. This ensured that all data was handled and treated the same way and allowed the business to reorient themselves again to be creative in approaching their customers.

A strange error indeed, but have tested it on two separate servers. I just can't access the asset files. For example ""plugins/offline/gdpr/assets/images/cookie-setup.jpg"" and ""plugins/offline/gdpr/assets/cookieBanner/banner.css"". I can access asset files in other plugins but not in this. For example ""plugins/flynsarmy/sociallogin/assets/marketplace/icon.png"" works just fine.





I just get a 404 error, and I can't seem to find out where the problem lies. If i try to access plugins via ""plugins/"" all plugins with a assets folder responds with a 403, but the plugins without an assets responds with a 404. But this plugin contains an asset folder. But still i get the 404 response.

The reason is that GDPR works with array and login checkbox with string and then it always insert html markup for label. 


`


return e107::getForm()->checkbox('gdpr', 1,false, $parm);


`





`return e107::getForm()->checkbox('autologin',1,false, LAN_LOGIN_8);`

Firstly, thanks for developing this. Tool works like a charm.


However, I found an issue with Azure blob storage.





The default name for a backup file is something like this:


""/storage/daily/daily-1561690800.gz""





However, as I found out from Azure tech support, they seem to have an issue with file names starting with an '/'.


It writes fine to the storage, however, because there's a leading slash, the lifecycle policy system cant delete this file (lifecycle policy is an azure system that can automatically delete files in cold storage).





To quote Azure support:





> Update on 22/08: PG has addressed the issue and provided the workaround.


> Root Cause:


> Lifecycle management has hit a bug which prevents lifecycle policy from working on blobs which have start with â€œ/â€ in their name.


> 


> Workaround:


> The bug fix required is involved and will take time (in the order of months) to get fully deployed. In the meantime, we recommend that you explicitly call delete on such blobs until the fix is fully deployed. The rest of blobs which donâ€™t start with / should be able to be managed automatically 


by the policy.





Currently I do hourly backups within the mgob pod (which expire after 24 hours), but upload a daily backup to Azure cool storage. However GDPR guidelines force me (for good reason) to remove backups after a month. Azure Lifecycle Policy helps me to do this automatically. 





I am fully aware that this is an Azure issue, however, is it possible to remove the leading slash in the filename when uploading the file to Azure?





I'm not well versed in Go, but I can imagine removing a leading slash is something I can fix myself and submit a pull request. However am not sure if that would break something down the line (or if the PR will be accepted because technically this no issue in mgob).





So filing this issue to let you (and others) know that Azure Lifecycle Policy isn't working well with mgob, and possibly some tips for a workaround :)

This would enable us to replace all SSN numbers or other sensitive / GDPR related material (names, emails, ip adresses, etc) with hashes and thus avoid storing them in plain text while keeping the ability to search for a specific one. Many analysis would still work using this methodolody, like `groupby()`, even without hashing a string before searching.





In parsers one could generate a hash and either overwrite the source field, or generate a new field and drop the original one.





A query could look like this : 





`ssn = hash(""1234561234"", salt=""ssn"")`

The current logic in the code was to try to parse the invert (space instead of 'T') for dates coming from GeoNetwork.

This post is to kick of the discussion for our new email criteria.





The new criteria should include:


I started with a list of things i things should be required:


secure mail extensions: SPF,DMARC, DKIM, StartTLS, DNSSEC, and Dane at a minimum, with a best case scenerio of also supporting mta-sts and smtp tls reporting.





We also have to discuss whether we will make GDPR compliancy a requirement or a preference.





Another thing that has to be discussed is if we hold on to our 5 eyes rule. this is because we don't know what has changed over the years, and which countries are trustworthy and which are not.





As a last thing, we need to figure out what we see as an acceptable privacy policy:

#1356 





# WHAT





I removed `Trackable` option of resource model (ex: `User`) from generator code.





# WHY





Most of devise_token_auth users would encountered following errors, because devise_token_auth's install command does not generate columns of Trackable option by default but in the model that was created by install command is including `:trackable` option.


So I want remove it.

- PHP Version: 7.2.25





### Description:


When I declare a custom blade directive, the argument's value is wrapped around '', which is not what I want. For example if I pass the string 


```php 


'gdpr-cookie-notice/script.js' 


``` 


as the argument, I'm expecting $script to be 


```php


""gdpr-cookie-notice/script.js""


``` 


and not 


```php


""'gdpr-cookie-notice/script.js'""


``` 


when using dd();





### Steps To Reproduce:


I have made a BladeServiceProvider to declare some directives like this one:


```php


    public function boot()


    {


        Blade::directive('script', function ($script) {


            dd($script);


        });


    }


```


and use it in my views like this:


```php


    @script('gdpr-cookie-notice/script.js')


```",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,cookies,N/A,0

When storing domain events in the event store, some of them contain person-related data, such as names, addresses, and so on. These data may need to be anonymized, pseudonymized, or even deleted. To be able to differ which domain events are affected and which aren't, we need a way to tell them apart. This means that for each event we save, we need to save an additional marker that tells whether the domain event contains potentially problematic data or not.





### What needs to be done to implement this feature?





- [ ] Introduce a new field to all event store implementations to mark events as relevant for GDPR


- [ ] Add a new parameter `containsPersonalData` (or something similar) to the `saveDomainEvents` function and use `true` as default


- [ ] Add and adjust tests",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

**Describe the bug**


Our Jira is in strict GDPR mode and only supports querying users by `accountId`. The [`_get_user_accountid`](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/blob/5c27f6ddafffc6110be1db4749fa67025852bcb6/jira/client.py#L1562) function fails in this instance.





**To Reproduce**


Steps to reproduce the behavior:


```


  issue = jira.create_issue(fields=issue_dict)


  assignee = 'my-user'


  jira.assign_issue(issue, assignee)


  assign(issue, assignee)


```


1. Further, we determine who to assign to dynamically. As the username is no longer returned by the API, we are not able to give [`assign_issue`](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/blob/5c27f6ddafffc6110be1db4749fa67025852bcb6/jira/client.py#L1572) the username.





**Expected behavior**


To be able to pass the `accountId` directly to [`assign_issue`](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/blob/5c27f6ddafffc6110be1db4749fa67025852bcb6/jira/client.py#L1572).

https://github.com/forkcms/forkcms/pull/3048,571282738.00000000000,11,1,1,N/A,cookies,Consent dialog,"## Type


- Enhancement


- Feature





## Pull request description





This PR enables developers to build GDPR compliant websites. GDPR affects all


website owners that target EU citizens.





In essence it will show a visitor a dialog wherein they can select their privacy


preferences. For example:





![Example of the consent dialog](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/preview_consent_dialog.png)





The preferences are stored in **functional** cookies so they are remembered.





**IMPORTANT**: it is still the responsibility of the developer/marketeer to


respect the visitors choices. Fork gives you the ability to do so.





### Configuration of the consent dialog





In the backend under ""Settings"" there is a new block which allows you to define


different privacy levels. You can add as many as needed. A visitor can agree to


each level separately.





![Configuration of the levels](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/configuration_of_levels.png)





For each level you need to add 2 translations, these translations will be used


in the consent dialog.





* Title, this is used as the label for the checkbox


* Text, this is used as a description for the level. As GDPR states a user needs


to make an informed disscision, so in the description you can describe what the


level means an how you will use the visitors agreement.





The reference code/name of the translation uses the level like explained below:





    {{ ('msg.PrivacyConsentLevel' ~ level|ucfirst ~ 'Title')|trans|raw }}


    {{ ('msg.PrivacyConsentLevel' ~ level|ucfirst ~ 'Text')|trans|raw }}





So for instance if you define the level ""statistics"" you will need to add 2


translations with the names:





* `PrivacyConsentLevelStatisticsTitle`


* `PrivacyConsentLevelStatisticsText`





<small>Remark: If you change the levels the consent dialog will be shown again


to all visitors. Previous choices will not be ticked.</small>





**There is one level that is always available: `functional`, this is always


allowed.** The user can not change this. It is added as it is a good practice to


explain your visitor what you store in these cookies.





### Usage





#### Retrieving choices in JavaScript


The choices of the visitor are available in `jsData` in the `privacyConsent`-object.





* `possibleLevels` contains all the levels that are defined thru the CMS.


* `levelsHash`, this is the hash that is used to determine if the levels are changed.


* `visitorChoices`, this contains the choice a user has made per level. The default is false.





#### Retrieving choices in PHP


A new service is available as `ForkCMS\Privacy\ConsentDialog`. This service


exposes some methods that you can use:





* `getLevels(bool $includeFunctional = false)`, this will return all the defined levels.


* `getVisitorChoices()`: returns an array with the users chosen preferences


* `hasAgreedTo(string $level)`: returns a boolean if the user has agreed to a given level. Returns false per default, also for non existing levels.





So for example if you want to do personalations if the user has agreed to the


`personalisation`-level, you can use the snippet below:





    if ($this->getContainer()->get(ForkCMS\Privacy\ConsentDialog::class)->hasAgreedTo('personalisation')) {


        ... your code ...


    }





#### Anonymize IP


Google Analytics has a feature called anonymizeIp. If you use our Google Analytics-


or Google Tag Manager integration we use the anonymizeIp feature by default.





In this case you need to add a privacy level with the name `statistics`. If you do


so, and the visitor agrees to it we will disable the IP anonymization.





<small>**Warning**: In Belgium this is not correct. The DPA decided that anonymizeIp


is not enough, therefor you should ask permission before tracking! See below how you


can achieve this.</small>





#### Google Tag Manager


If you use Google Tag Manager it is completely up to you to adhere the visitors


preferences. Below is explained on how it can be configured.





##### Create a variables


* Open Variables


* Click ""New"" next to ""User-Defined Variables""


* Name it ""Privacy Consent - DataLayer - Level XXX"", eg: Privacy Consent - DataLayer - Level statistics


* Choose ""Data Layer Variable"" for the type


* Use ""privacyConsentLevelXXXAgreed"" as the value for ""Data Layer Variable Name"", replace XXX with the ucfirst version of you level name


* Enable ""Set Default Value"", and set the Default Value to ""false""





![Example configuration for data layer variables](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_variable_configuration.png)





Do this for all the levels you defined.





##### Create triggers


* Open Triggers


* Click ""New""


* Name it ""Privacy Consent - Check - Level XXX not allowed"", eg: Privacy Consent - Check - Level statistics not allowed


* Choose ""Custom event"" for the Trigger Type


* Use "".*"" as Event name, and tick ""Use regex matching""


* Select ""Some custom Events""


* Select the relevant variable, something like DataLayer - Privacy Consent - Level XXX""


* Choose ""Equals"" as the condition and ""false"" as the value





![Not allowed trigger configuration](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_trigger_not_allowed_configuration.png)





* Click ""New""


* Name it ""Privacy Consent - Event - Level XXX - Agreed"", eg: Privacy Consent - Event - Level statistics - Agreed


* Choose ""Custom event"" for the Trigger Type


* Use ""privacyConsentLevelXXXAgreed"" as Event name, replace XXX with the ucfirst name of your level name


* Select ""All Custom Events""





![Event trigger configuration](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_trigger_event_configuration.png)





Repeat these steps for each level you have defined





##### Load a tag only when it is allowed


* Open the tag you want to configure. For instance Hotjar


* Edit the triggers


* Add ""Privacy Consent - Event - Level XXX - Agreed"" on the Firing Triggers. This will add the tag if the user agrees.


* Add ""Privacy Consent - Check - Level XXX not allowed"" on the Exceptions. This will prevent the tag from loading when the user did not agree.





![Tag configuration](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_tag_configuration.png)





By adding the exception the Tag won't be fired. This is the case when a visitor


has not agreed to anything. In that case the consent dialog is shown.


When the visitor clicks ""Save my preferences"", we will fire an event per agreed


level: `privacyConsentLevelXXXAgreed`. This will fire the tag, as it is configured


as a Firing trigger.





If the visitor visits another page the exception won't be triggered as the variable


is true. So the tag will be fired by the ""All Pages"" trigger.





### Removed features


Adding new features also means cleaning up non relevant features, so some are removed:





### Cookie bar


This new Consent Dialog replaces the previous Cookie Bar.





This means you can't use the following methods anymore:





* `$this->get('fork.cookie')->hasAllowedCookies()`


* `$this->get('fork.cookie')->hasHiddenCookieBar()`





### Visitor Id


The visitor Id that was generated and stored in a cookie does not exist anymore.

https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-services/issues/1934,571788133.00000000000,10,0,0,N/A,N/A,Colorado tax rates inaccurate,"The WC site I'm administering seems to be applying inaccurate tax rates. I never applied a tax plugin since I thought I read that this plugin has that built in. It's possible this is related to https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-services/issues/1867.





When I reviewed some of the tax rates at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=tax&section=standard`, multiple rates don't appear accurate. Additionally, it appears Colorado sales tax are primarily based on the Jurisdiction Codes for a County or City. WC has Zip and City but I don't understand how that translates to these Jurisdiction Codes.





I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this without either entering rates manually (which, I can't really use the Jurisdiction Code) or using another plugin. If I decide to install the Taxjar plugin, is it any different than what this plugin is already importing from Taxjar?





For reference, I think the most current rates can be found here:


https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/tax/sales-and-use-tax-rates-lookup





Thanks for the help.








-----------------------------------------------------------








EDIT: September 22, 2020





For purposes of privacy, adhering to GDPR, and to protect identities, I am giving estimated addresses that duplicate the same rates and issues as the original addresses.





I tested this on both a staging site and live site, getting the same incorrect tax rate.

26851 Rd P


Dolores, Colorado 81323





**Destination address**

The tax rate being applied is 4.5%, which is what was imported into WooCommerce at some point, found at `wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=tax&section=standard`:

[According to TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/sales-tax-calculator/), the rate should be 8%:

https://github.com/coryhouse/ama/issues/22,596225424.00000000000,1,0,0,N/A,N/A,What do you think of Full Stack Web Application Development?,"Hi Cory,





I am just going through your HTML5 Web Component Fundamentals course on Pluralsight... I am a complete beginner with some mandatory holidays, caused by the virus, so I decided to create a web application. I have written macros in excel before, and a few macros for a 3D design software both using VB, but that is about all my coding knowledge. I have watched about 45 hours of Pluralsight courses in 4 days, and I struggle to find the relevant things, as most beginner videos explain the basics too basic, but don't go into details on the genuinely new info. (I don't even need coding to understand what an if - else statement is - my mom shouted it at me enough as a child -, but what on earth is git? Sure I downloaded and installed it to follow the demos, now what, will it scan my entire computer and sell all my personal data???)  Yes I have very serious trust issues.





Your course was the first one that I actually started to find interesting, and the one that made most sense.





As I am drowning in resources - there are 95+hrs of Pluralsight courses on HTML CSS and JS (basics), purely on how to write these from scratch - a common element in these courses is: ""Here is how you do it from scratch on your own, but don't do that, here is 5 alternatives for - libraries, frameworks etc. but you also have to learn these on top of what you just learned, they will introduce issues with dependencies, and you will struggle to switch between these. Good luck!!""





So 5th day into learning web application development I think I would like to go down the Full Stack route, assuming I understood that term right (Developing both Front and Rear end) and re-invent every wheel that rolls my way. <joke>Luckily as a Mechanical Design Engineer working in Motorsports, that's also what I do when I am not on holiday</joke>





After the essay, here are the questions:


- Whats your preferred method of deploying your web applications? 


- Why? 


- How are you certain that they are safe, both from hackers and from the third party you are/may be deploying it through? (I have trust issues with completely free resources that just say ""promise we won't look"" in a fancy formatted document)





The app I am developing (a demo for - as a first project) exists already and was created in the early 2000s and is unsupported now. It handles personal data, and while I will not input any real GDPR sensitive data into my demo app, I would like to begin development with the condition that it must be THAT secure. 





- What are 'Must have'-s even if I try to go about it the 'From Scratch' way?


- Do you have any more courses that go into detail on any of the topics I mentioned in my essay? (Security, frameworks and libraries, 'New Starter - kit' of 'Must Have'-s?


- If you personally don't, can you recommend certain courses to watch, read, work through?





Thank you!

https://otwarchive.atlassian.net/browse/AO3-5915





## Purpose





Some browsers that support localStorage do weird things like stop you from putting anything in it in private mode. This means visitors using those browsers can't get past the GDPR TOS prompt.





So what we're doing here is testing setting something in localStorage and then, if that doesn't work, repurposing it to create (or update or remove) a cookie.

https://github.com/cta-wave/common-media-client-data/issues/60,640009761.00000000000,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy,"Feedback has been to review this project through the lens provided by the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/ established by the W3C. While we are not a W3C spec, it is a useful tool in evaluating our security and privacy posture. To this end I have attempted to answer the following questions for the CMCD project:





1. What information might this feature expose to Web sites or other parties, and for what purposes is that exposure necessary?


    1. This spec relays information from a media player to the CDN from which it is requesting media objects. The information concerns attributes of the object being requested (such as bitrate, duration, object type), the state of the player (buffer level, rebuffering status, startup mode) and the session (sessionID and contentID). The exposure is necessary because it allows the CDN to a) optimize delivery of the object b) apply intelligent timeouts and retry thresholds c) Analyze disparate requests as being a playback session and d) trigger immediate network health alerts for poor performance. 


2. Is this specification exposing the minimum amount of information necessary to power the feature?


    1. Yes, we believe so. Over 35 data points were originally proposed, of which we have accepted 16. We have evaluated each on the litmus test of ""is it necessary"" and ""what is the benefit""? For each key/value pair accepted, we have a clear value proposition. 


3. How does this specification deal with personal information or personally-identifiable information or information derived thereof?


    1. All PII is explicitly prohibited. The spec indicates that ""Personally Identifiable Information, such as IP address, cookie information and location data is intentionally not carried by the specification. ""


4. How does this specification deal with sensitive information?


    1. None of the defined keys carry sensitive information, such as  financial data, health information, location, or credentials. 


5. Does this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?


    1. The ""sessionID"" key is the only data point that persists across requests. This ID is required to be a GUI and the UUID standard is suggested. It ties together the audio, video and manifest requests when a particular asset is played. It is never used twice, even if the same user plays another assets, or the same asset is repeatedly viewed by the end user. It cannot be used to identify the user, or the content and it does not persist across browsing sessions. 


6. What information from the underlying platform, e.g. configuration data, is exposed by this specification to an origin?


    1. Of the reserved keys, the ones closest to configuration data would be requested maximum throughput and buffer length. These can conceivably be set differently players at levels that could be averaged over time and then used as part of a fingerprinting surface. To mitigate this, the spec requires these values to be rounded to the nearest 100mbps. This bucketing lowers the entropy associated with these parameters and thus reduces the fingerprinting surface. An explicit key called 'DeviceID' was proposed but then removed from the spec due to fingerprinting concerns.  


7. Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a userâ€™s device


    1. No it does not. 


8. What data does this specification expose to an origin? Please also document what data is identical to data exposed by other features, in the same or different contexts.


    1. The spec exposes the following information to an origin. In manby cases, the origin already has access to this information if it were to parse the object being delivered


        1. Encoded bitrate - the bitrate of the media object being requested . Origin can discover by parsing. 


        1. Buffer length - the buffer length of the media player


        1. Buffer starvation -  a Boolean flag indicating if a rebuffer event has taken place since the last object was requested. 


        1. Content ID - A unique string identifying the current content. This does not increase information leakage, as the object URL is visible to the receiver and itself a reference to the content. This ID simply ties together the thousands of separate objects which comprise a media asset. 


        1. Object duration - the media time duration of the object. Origin can discover by parsing. 


        1. Deadline - the minimum time for the CDN to deliver the object before the player rebuffers. 


        1. Measured throughput - the throughput between client and server as measured by the client


        1. Next object request - the next object the client intends to request. This is used to request a prefetch by the CDN edge. Must be a relative path to the current request. 


        1. Next range request - a range request associated with the next object request. 


        1. Object type	 - whether the current file represents an audio, video, init, caption, or manifest file. 


        1. Playback rate - current playback speed of the player


        1. Requested maximum throughput -  a means for a player to voluntarily ask for delivery to be throttled. 


        1. Streaming format - type of media presentation, such as HLS or DASH. 


        1. Session ID - a randomly generated GUID, such as UUID, used to tie together object requests across a single piece of media. 


        1. Stream type - live or VOD


        1. Startup	 - boolean true if the player is in start/seeking/recovery mode.


        1. CMCD version - version to accommodate future updates. Not sent if version == 1. 


9. Does this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms?


    1. No. 


10. Does this specification allow an origin to access other devices?


    1. No. 


11. Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agentâ€™s native UI?


    1. No, this is client to server communication, not server to client. 


12. What temporary identifiers might this this specification create or expose to the web?


    1. The SessionID can be considered a temporary identifier. It is randomly generated, never repeats for the same user and is never reused for other sessions. 


13. How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?


    1. The first party receiver of the data is the CDN serving the media objects. The CDN will log this information in its delivery log files. Log files are considered proprietary data of the customer whose content is being delivered. These log files are subject to privacy constraints, such as GDPR. 


14. How does this specification work in the context of a user agentâ€™s Private Browsing or ""incognito"" mode?


    1. A media player may optionally send the CMCD data. The spec does not restrain whether the data should be sent when a browser-based player is in Private Browsing mode. 


15. Does this specification have a ""Security Considerations"" and ""Privacy Considerations"" section?


    1. Yes, Section 5 deals with security and privacy concerns. 


16. Does this specification allow downgrading default security characteristics?


   1. This allows data to be attached to a HTTP request.

https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/324,641208223.00000000000,14,0,0,N/A,N/A,Privacy Considerations for service endpoints,"Prior to PING and linked to our many [layering discussions in SDS](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store/issues/80), our Privacy Considerations section and [10.4 Herd Privacy](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#herd-privacy) in particular might be reviewed. 





[5.7](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#service-endpoints) says: ""One of the primary purposes of a DID document is to enable discovery of service endpoints."" The Privacy Considerations section does a good job of discussing correlation risks in general but is light on the risks and mitigations related to service endpoints.





As I understand it, the relationship between pseudonymous DIDs, herd immunity, and service endpoints implies that, in all ""Privacy by Design"" use-cases, the number of service endpoints SHOULD be one in order to reduce the risk of correlation and enhance the effectiveness of Herd Privacy.





[Requesting Parties](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/248#issuecomment-645486701) who discover a pseudonymous DID by whatever means, especially a search of ""de-identified"" metadata in various directories, SHOULD be directed to some kind of **consent-based access control service** with a minimum loss of entropy. This is especially important for DID methods that consider mitigation the GDPR Right to be Forgotten and in light of the fact that GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA all allow unlimited use of de-identified data with little concern on enforcement of re-identification.





My suggestion would be to enhance the Privacy Considerations section with a discussion of how access control services could be proxied or otherwise ""tumbled"" by a herd privacy intermediary that could be chosen by the DID controller or data subject independently of the access control service or not. It would then be up to the DID controller to decide whether to use a dumb proxy mechanism like TOR or an access control service that provides herd privacy as the one service endpoint in a pseudonymous DID.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

We should have account configuration settings available in Prebid Server.





In addition to validating that an account (publisher id) is known to the prebid-server, account-specific configurations would be needed to support planned functionality. The Java version has the following per-account configurations, for example:





- eventsEnabled: to control win notification events such as #1202 or video impression tracking #1015


- enforceGdpr


- bannerCacheTtl


- videoCacheTtl


- analyticsSamplingFactor





PBS-Go has a simple yaml accounts list in legacy code, not used for openrtb2 endpoints and with the current definition as a list of strings, only useful for validation. PBS-Java supports a yaml file with a more complex structure, and a database source.





### Implementation





For implementation, supporting the same data sources as PBS-Java could be useful to some extent and the ability to refresh the data in flight is needed as well. The HTTP api source is well suited for this purpose, even more versatile than the database in my opinion. FileFetcher less so (I will create a ticket for separate discussion on this).

This PR uses the [Nginx JS Module](https://www.nginx.com/blog/introduction-nginscript/) to check query params in the incoming requests, and filter out any that match the Email regex.





I see this as a first step in supporting log filtering, if needed I think we can expand it and formalise an API around the JS modules, to make it easier to add new filters or instance specific filters. But I would rather wait until we have a clearer understanding of what we would need before trying to solve that problem ðŸ˜„ . 





## How to Test


**Testing with filtering enabled**


1. Clone the branch


1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build`


1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`


1. Using the browser (or curl) go to http://localhost:50132/?email=john.smith@smith.com


1. In the nginx logs you should see `email=[EMAIL FILTERED]`, like the screenshots





**Testing with filtering disabled**


1. Stop the docker containers session if it's still running


1. Change the [`FILTER_LOGS` param](https://github.com/degica/barcelona/pull/601/files#diff-71027439e4e13f5ebb931f5ea1f97b66R14) to ""false"" (or remove it entirely)


1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`


1. Using the browser (or curl) go to http://localhost:50132/?email=john.smith@smith.com


1. In the nginx logs you should see `email=john.smith@smith.com`

I'm new to github and have run out of ideas on why I've seen a significant drop in prebid revenue and cpm since we released LiveRamp's CMP on our site earlier this week. 





We're running Prebid version 3.18.0


We released the Liveramp CMP across our site (cv-library.co.uk) at the beginning of the week. Since then I have seen Prebid revenue drop off a cliff and both Google AdX and Adsense CPM's have dropped by half. 





When I debug Prebid on the site (e.g. https://www.cv-library.co.uk/accountancy-jobs?pbjs_debug=true) I can see the CMP load, when I consent I then see the consent string present. 


I can also see that on the surface it appears we are providing the consent string in our Bid requests to partners (see attached sshot). 


There are other prebid calls on the page (different versions) that relate to other partners loaded in our ad server which I'm not too concerned about for the time being. 





It looks like both the GDPR Consent Module and GDPR Enforcement Module are working as expected. 





What i can't explain is why our Prebid partners have stopped bidding or are bidding at a much lower rate. 





If anyone can provide any suggestions I'm all ears. 





First thoughts are:


Some sort of Timeout issue


CMP is interfering with the bid requests in some way...


There is an issue with the Prebid version we are using


Under Vendor data the 'cmpVersion' is set to '1' - should this not be '2'


<img width=""1429"" alt=""Screenshot 2020-07-22 at 10 48 00"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68640428/88162436-4275a680-cc09-11ea-9742-9bec7d4911e0.png"">





I can see another thread related to Quantcast here that sounds similar to the issue we are having - https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/5462





I've contacted Prebid partners and am waiting to hear back as well as discussions with LiveRamp but nothing as yet has presented itself as the potential issue.





If anyone can take a look and advise at all I'd be extremely grateful!!





Many thanks





Matt

https://github.com/jupyter/telemetry/pull/49,684789644.00000000000,6,0,0,N/A,N/A,Fine grained data collection,"This replaces #46. The PR was originally directed at handling personal data. Now, it's a bit more general.





Here, I've changed the `allowed_schemas` trait to explicitly list all event properties that should be recorded based on their name or category. This can be used to filter-out personal data.





Summary of the changes made:


* `allowed_schemas` can now be a dictionary describing *what* data to keep when recording an event (see example below).


* schemas require a `categories` field under each property. This field can be used to group properties.


* `unrestricted` is a special category that means the named property will always be recorded when that event is recorded.





## How it works





`allowed_schemas` is now a nested dictionary where the keys are the schema IDs, and the values are dictionaries with two optional fields, `properties` and `categories`, describing the properties in the event that should be recorded.





As an example, 


```python


allowed_schemas = {


    ""uri.to.schema"": {


        ""allowed_properties"": [""name"", ""email""],


        ""allowed_categories"": [""personal-information""]


    }


}








c.EventLog.allowed_schemas=allowed_schemas


```


When the `uri.to.schema` event is recorded, it will include the properties, `email` and `name`, **and** any other properties with the category label `personal-information`. All other properties will not be recorded.





## Personal data





While this PR doesn't specifically address personal data, it provides a mechanism to filter out personal data. For example, properties can be labeled with categories like `hippa`, `gdpr`, `pii`, etc. to make filtering under different regimes possible.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

Bug





## Description


While gdprEnforcement module is used and purpose: ""storage"" is set to false in prebid setConfig(), prebid debugging in console reports ""WARNING: TCF2: enforcing P1 and P2"". I don't know if this is a bug on logging or it actually enforces P1 regardless of configuration.





## Steps to reproduce


Using gdprEnforcement module with the following configuration


                consentManagement: {


                    gdpr: {


                        cmpApi: ""iab"",


                        timeout: 20000,


                        defaultGdprScope: true,


                        rules: [{


                            purpose: ""storage"",


                            enforcePurpose: false,


                            enforceVendor: false


                        }]


                    },


                    usp: {


                        cmpApi: ""iab"",


                        timeout: 100


                    }


                }





## Test page

### Expected results


I shouldn't get a warning about P1 being enforced

Perhaps using a database setting like NEWSFEED_EMAIL_ENCRYPT = True|False would enable/disable this feature. This way if your database was ever stolen/hacked, the attacker would not be able to see the emails. 





But If someone changes this setting later on the user would probably need to do some sort of data migrations. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/writing-migrations/ which is not really desirable. Unless it can somehow get built into the app?





SELECT SQL queries and django get() should be able to view the decrypted emails. 





Some ideas would be to do something like django-fernet-fields which uses the SECRET_KEY to do both the encryption and decryption. Or if you are using postgres, do something like django-pgcrypto-fields which uses a postgres pgcrypto extension.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

Unless you have a paid Zapier account, then users are limited to 100 zaps/month, which is potentially not enough for a smallâ€“mid-sized membership site. And even with Zapier, it introduces an unnecessary 3rd step between JetEngine and a mailing list service. And the inbuilt 'send email' function is limited in terms of design options, which doesn't make a great impression on new users.

Therefore, I request further integrations with a wider range of mailing list services, removing the need for Zapier. My personal request is for Mailerlite, since they have a more flexible free pricing plan than MailChimp and offer good GDPR solutions for EU-based websites/customers/members. 

Adding more integrations, will immediately ease the workflow in JetEngine when registering new users or subscribing them to mailing lists. It will also provide greater flexibility and choice to JetEngine users, when deciding which mailing list service to use and when deciding whether to buy JetEngine or another membership plugin. For example, they may need to transfer existing mailing lists over to JetEngine profile builder and might not want the added complication/limitation of using Zapier. This will make JetEngine a more competitive choice compared with other site-membership plugins.

Elementor already has a wide range of 3rd party mailing list vendors for their form widgets. But this cannot be used by most JetEngine users when managing new user/member registrations. This use case is particularly crucial for JetEngine subscribers.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

Your plugin doesn't appear to store any user data so you should be able to implement the simple null provider class.





Sites that use continuous integration processes will not be able to use your plugin because Moodle runs unit tests which check to see if all extra plugins include the privacy class.





More information on the privacy class is here:

I decided to turn off uBO and try out AdNauseam.


The config and the lists setup in uBO and AdNauseam are identical


So I was expecting AdNauseam to be hiding crap as good as uBO.


In practice, it turned to be not as expected, and the following crap started being visible after I switched:


- Popups and overlays related to cookies / gdpr & terms of use / privacy terms / privacy notice / such stuff on all websites.


- Advertised search results on Startpage.


- Maybe something more that I no longer remember.





Doubt that ""Your settings"" and ""Your filter lists"" play any role here, as mentioned they are identical in uBO and AdNauseam, and uBO cuts all the bad stuff very well.





Am I doing something wrong?


Or is it an expected behavior of AdNauseam cutting the stuff not as effectively as uBO?


In case of the latter, I should keep both uBO and AdNauseam active, and configure them in a way that they have no match in active settings and lists (active in the former, disabled in the latter), to cut the crap and in the same time let AdNauseam do its mission, are there any recommendations on how to do it the best / most practical way?

The application was found to use weak cryptographic algorithms during app runtime. These methods are usually easily reverse engineered, so the data is not really protected very well. An attacked with access to the encrypted data could easily see the data that was obfuscated.##Evaluation Criteria
It is a best practice not to use insecure methods to encrypt data. However, not all companies require this. The context table below should be evaulated against the standards for the app. Also, please note there is a separate finding specifically for sensitive data being encrypted using these methods.

### Recommendation

Change to using algrythms that are secure. Guidance can be found [for Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/cryptography) and [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/GeneralPurposeCrypto/GeneralPurposeCrypto.html).

The information specified has been found within local application folders or external storage locations on the device. Data written to device storage can be accessed through several attack vectors.  An attacker who is able to access the charging port may be able to access this data if the user acknowledges the trust or with a rooted/jailbroken device. Often, data backup utilities can also export local files with its backup and, if not encrypted, can be then accessed by an attacker. While malware is also a concern, it is less common than attacks concerning physical device access. If these values are exposed they can be used to track and phish users, access their account, or circumvent protections within the app.

### Recommendation

Sensitive data should not be stored in local app files without the right protection level and unencrypted. It is highly recommended to encrypt all locally stored sensitive data using a strong encryption algorithm. It is also recommended to set the strongest possible data protection level on the file containing the sensitive data. Review the data protection level(s) set on the file(s) listed here and ensure that they are either `NSFileProtectionComplete` for complete protection or `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication` to be protected until the user first authenticates to the device. Details and code snippets can be found at  [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/encrypting_your_app_s_files](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/encrypting_your_app_s_files)

The context table below gives the location on the device that the specified information was stored insecurely.

=======





The Khan saves player name as plain text on the database, what isn't compliance with the LGPD/GDPR laws. To be compliant with these laws now the Khan accepts a new environment variable `KHAN_SECURITY_ENCRYPTIONKEY` which should be a 32 byte length and will be used to encrypt the player name.





What was done


=======


* Create `security.encryptionKey` on app


* Refactor DAO to segmentize the player serialization field, in a way to concentrate the decryption logic in the `models/player.go`


* Add `util/secure.go` which will hold all encryption logic


* Add tests to `util/secure.go` in `util/secure_test.go`


* Add tests to routes that use the player name",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

Users can do it on the browser, but it's fair to say the industry is betting on people not touching the default. We can help them by doing it on the server - because by default, every web server opts people into tracking as of now.


To opt users out, you need a Permissions Policy HTTP header as described [here](https://github.com/WICG/floc#opting-out-of-computation).

Possibly related to the closed issue #5833


Came across this when building out the campaigns for the Mautic Community GDPR / newsletter signup options:





We have a form with a checkbox list, which allows people to select what information they receive from us.





We have a campaign which uses the 'form field value' option to push them into the correct segments based on what is set in the checkbox (a yes value for the field equalling the relevant option:





![screenshot-community eu mautic net-2021 05 13-16_24_06 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2930593/118150615-a96b8280-b40a-11eb-9649-34dbf48b938b.png)





The form submissions are working, but they are not making their way into the correct segments.





In another place I am using a radio button yes/no for GDPR consent, and that part is working correctly - they have a tag applied if they select yes, receive an email, and are unsubscribed/removed if they set no.





![screenshot-community eu mautic net-2021 05 13-16_24_52 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2930593/118150650-b12b2700-b40a-11eb-80be-9dd096b6a234.png)





Perhaps this is an issue with how checkbox or multi-select options are being managed/processed by the form field value option in the campaign workflow?

### Steps to reproduce

Description: 

<style>strong {    color: #ef5350!important;}</style><strong>Assertion </strong>
<b><font color=""#ef5350""> Name:  </font></b>  HTTP Authentication Scheme    <b><font color=""#ef5350""><sup>( 1 )</sup></font></b><br>
<br>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Overview: </strong> Authentication is the process of identifying whether a client is eligible to access a resource. The HTTP protocol supports authentication as a means of negotiating access to a secure resource.<br>
<br>
The general HTTP authentication framework is used by several authentication schemes. Schemes can differ in security strength and in their availability in client or server software. The server can specify multiple authentication schemes for the client to choose from. The most commonly used API Authentication schemes are <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Basic </li>
<li>API Key </li>
<li>OAuth or OAuth 2.0  </li>
</ul>
The ""Basic"" HTTP authentication scheme transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. As the user ID and password are passed over the network as clear text (it is base64 encoded, but base64 is a reversible encoding), the basic authentication scheme is not secure. HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication. Without these additional security enhancements, basic authentication should not be used to protect sensitive or valuable information.<br>
<br>
OAuth is the most widespread method used at it delivers a ton of benefits, from ease of use to a federated system module, and most importantly offers scalability of security.<br>
<br>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Severity: </strong>  Not having a secure Authentication Scheme can lead to expose of Sensitive Data and Sensitive Data Exposure is rated at 3rd position in 2017 OWASP Top 10.  <strong class=""text-danger""><sup>( 2 )</sup></strong><br>
<br>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Vulnerability Impact:  </strong>   Authentication mechanisms and schemes, if implemented incorrectly, may allow attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently, compromising system's ability to identify the client/user and may compromise API security overall. The following are some of the consequences.<br>
<br> 
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary Data Exposure and Data theft.</li>
<li>Exposure of Clients data and Personal Identifiable Information.</li>
<li>Can be financially devastating to the organization.</li>
<li>Non-compliance to data regulations like EU GDPR or local privacy laws.</li>
</ul>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Remediation:  </strong>  The following may be employed to implement proper authentication scheme. <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication.</li>
<li>Classify data processed, stored or transmitted by an application. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.</li>
<li>Apply controls as per the classification.</li>
<li>Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and secure parameters. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</li>
</ul>

## Description





Replaced peopleTable for users with proposalPeopleTable so that they cannot see the full user list. Now they can only see users that they have previously collaborated with as well as inviting existing users by email. 





I based the new component on the people table so it has some of the same code and structure.





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81559866/125451251-cdbafe73-04af-402c-9b52-4c3c37f91d9d.png)








## Motivation and Context





This solves this GDPR issue: https://github.com/UserOfficeProject/stfc-user-office-project/issues/146





## How Has This Been Tested





For the cypress tests, I have modified them to work on the new table. I then create a dummy proposal then log in as a user officer and edit the proposal from there to render a peopleTable so both tables are tested. 





## Changes





Created new component proposalsPeopleTable.tsx that is rendered when a user is creating a proposal. With this component, users can see users subset of the users that they have previously collaborated with or add an existing user by email. 





The new preivousCobaloraters query finds a user's most recent collaborators (the collaborators from the most recent proposal they worked on) as well as their 10 most collaborated with users.





The email box has some validation on it giving different error messages e.g. User is already on the proposal. It also renders a more detailed message if the email queried does not exist as this within our existing system as there are privacy settings possibly stopping a user from being found. This message may be something we could make site-specific if needed. 








We have also added some logic about who appears in add principal investigator/co-proposer lists based on if they are on the project already.





- If a user is on the proposal already as a principle investigator they will not appear in the lists


- If a user a co-proposer they will not be able to be added a co-proposer. 


- If a user is a co-proposer they can be 'elevated' to the principal investigator, this will remove them as a co-proposer and remove the current principal investigator from the proposal


- If a user removes someone as principal investigator they will become a co-proposer.


- A user cannot remove themselves as a co-proposer





There is now a partipantModel that renders peopleTable or proposalPeopleTable based on if the current userRole, if it, not a user officer, and if a new argument called participant (which is set in proposalParticipant(s) components) is set it renders the proposalPeopleTable else it renders peopleTable.





Created 2 new gql querys: getPreviousColaborators and getBasicUserDeatailsByEmail. 





## Possible Inprovments





Users that have been found by email could have some permeance within the list as currently they are lost when proposalPeopleTable is closed





This is my first time properly coding with react so if there is anything that can be improved around that please let me know. 





I am not sure where else this table might be used or if I have inadvertently placed it somewhere I should not.

### How are you deploying your application?

### Describe the Bug

On the first page load of https://chatbooks.com in Safari (both on macOS and on iOS devices (tried on iPad, iPhone, iPad Pro), and ONLY the first page load, the page is rendered with empty containers.





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2243596/129984997-3b9715c4-76fd-45fb-8130-d312e1c404e8.png)





Looking at the Dev Tools, all of the HTML elements are showing up, including the text/images that should be populating those boxes (the pink bar at the bottom is a GDPR banner, for instance), and all of the elements are interactive. If you hover over a navbar link, the highlight will show and if you click on it, the animation of a panel with a drop shadow is visible, but that panel has no text or images in it.





This ONLY happens on the first load with a clean Browser History. As soon as the page is reloaded once, it loads perfectly every time until the history is cleared (cache, etc.). This also only happens in Safari. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera even all render perfectly. Even IE renders it ugly, but at least the contents are there...

### Expected Behavior

The contents of the page should be displayed on first load.

### To Reproduce

Having never visited https://chatbooks.com, visit in a Safari browser. It's not 100% reproducible, but at least 75% of the time it will load with no contents. Refresh the browser to see the contents of the page load properly.





To eliminate domain issues, you can also visit https://chatbooks.vercel.app and the same thing happens.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

# Notes on data fetching and loading





## OSM API





It is possible doing aggregated quality analysis by using OSM API, but only on small areas.





## Overpass API





Overpass API is able to return large areas (like a whole city), but information about the individual nodes should be fetch over multiple OSM API calls, which seems not feasible due to bad performances.





## OSM planet full history





The planet file containing the history cannot be accessed directly as a regular database, because it has no index. It could be interesting to access to it as a Torrent, requesting only the blocks that are needed (there are some proof-of-concept sqlite databases served over torrent), but a spatial index should be generated first and various custom methods to access to the PBF data should be developed, to avoid conversion and import into a regular database, which would use even more space and resources.





## Ohsome





Ohsome [does not support](https://github.com/GIScience/ohsome-api/issues/197) contributors analysis we are doing at the moment, while Overpass API has even [more limited support](https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/issues/2) for temporal analysis.





Ohsome provides a fullHistoryBox API which provided mixed results; it seems that it is more convenient not to split the areas in too many subgroups and limit the number of concurrent requests. At the moment, it seems the only viable solution to do such kind of analysis, without having to store and keep synchronized the whole OSM history. It cannot be used to return the list of the unique usernames or user IDs. This is done on purpose: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/8/88/GDPR_Position_Paper.pdf.





Ohsome support has been recently merged: https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/pull/138. A caching mechanism should follow to further improve performances





# Notes on data rendering/serving





## TMS raster





Data could be rendered as a raster and served as a silly map layer over TMS. This would require the server to apply colors in advance, which can be problematic, as tiles would be rendered in parallel, without knowing the minimum nor the maximum over a given area. That would require some sort of user interaction to set the more appropriate scale while setting some reasonable defaults.





## Leaflet.markercluster





Points could be aggregated in clusters represented by a bigger point. This is the most promising solution at the moment, beign explored by this PR https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/pull/145.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

# Anonymous Analytics Policy





## 1. Functional Specification





### I. Summary





This specification describes an exhaustive list of anonymous metrics collected by the MeiliSearch binary. It also describes the tools we use for this collection and how we identify a Meilisearch instance.





### II. Motivation





At MeiliSearch, our vision is to provide an easy-to-use search solution that meets the essential needs of our users. At all times, we strive to understand our users better and meet their expectations in the best possible way.





Although we can gather needs and understand our users through several channels such as Github, Slack, surveys, interviews or roadmap votes, we realize that this is not enough to have a complete view of MeiliSearch usage and features adoption. By cross-referencing our product discovery phases with aggregated quantitative data, we want to make the product much better than what it is today. Our decision-making will be taken a step further to make a product that users love.





### III. Explanation





#### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)





The metrics collected are non-sensitive, non-personal and do not identify an individual or a group of individuals using MeiliSearch. The data collected is secured and anonymized. We do not collect any data from the values stored in the documents.





We, the MeiliSearch team, provide an email address so that users can request the removal of their data: privacy@meilisearch.com.<br>


Thanks to the unique identifier generated for their MeiliSearch installation (`Instance uuid` when launching MeiliSearch), we can remove the corresponding data from all the tools we describe below. Any questions regarding the management of the data collected can be sent to the email address as well.





#### Tools





##### Segment





The collected data is sent to [Segment](https://segment.com/). Segment is a platform for data collection and provides data management tools.





##### Amplitude





[Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) is a tool for graphing and highlighting collected data. Segment feeds Amplitude so that we can build visualizations according to our needs.

[Security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security)Â Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a type of software that gathers log data and real-time event data generated from systems throughout an organization?s technology infrastructure and turns it into actionable information. Important uses of SIEM tools include alertingÂ [security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security)Â staff about immediateÂ [security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security)Â issues that need to be dealt with, and automated monitoring for compliance with important regulations such as HIPAA, PCI/DSS, and GDPR.

Among the systems that a SIEM solution collates data from are antivirus software, firewalls, host systems, database servers, web filters, network switches, and more. The SIEM tool takes all this information and aggregates it for a broad end-to-end view. The software then analyzes the aggregate data to find patterns and correlations and provide reports onÂ [security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security)-related incidents and events.

### **Best Practices**

- Establish requirements to get a well-defined picture of the requirements for your SIEM deployment, including objectives, prioritized targets from those objectives, and the overall workflow.
- Collect as much diverse data as possible. More information is better when it comes to feeding data into a SIEM system because the essential role of these tools is to take a bunch of log and event data and answer meaningful questions from it. But those questions can't be answered without sufficient data.
- Have a comprehensive incident response plan.

Related to this now being a non-namespace package


this is something we discussed a bit [here](https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/issues/89#issuecomment-817110452); in summary:





In order to keep this backwards compatible, `__init__.py` is just


`from .rexport import *`, so this should work with anything using `my/reddit.py`


currently. If someone wants gdpr/pushshift, they have to opt in by changing imports


to `from my.reddit.all` and updating their config. In the future (once promnesia has supported


`my.reddit.all` for a while, probably a few months at least), the `__init__.py` can be removed

Current PHAR distribution of gdpr-dump (Version 2.3.0) errors on PHP 8.1. This **DOES NOT** happen when installing gdpr-dump from git (and do a fresh `composer install`). I guess it's related to the version of `symfony/console` shipped in the PHAR.





Edit: Okay, it's not the version of `symfony/console`. The error occurs due to the way gdpr-dump PHAR build works. The `Compiler` class uses `php_strip_whitespace` to strip all the comments from source code, which eliminates the `#[\ReturnTypeWillChange]` attribute.

## Motivation and context


As the brainlife platform moves towards engaging clinical researchers and/or groups using non-open (or otherwise protected) datasets, it may be worthwhile to begin exploring how to transfer / query / verify institutional permissions for accessing particular datasets. 





Currently, as I recall it, access to a dataset / project is managed by the admin of that project.  Beyond that protocol though, there aren't really any guardrails in place to constrain their activities as admin.  In this way they are at their liberty to add other users to the project / dataset as they see fit.  Particularly for open datasets this is ideal and allows for nimble development and analysis in a project.  However, for projects potentially involving clinical or other protected data, this setup may be too permissive.  As such, it may be worthwhile to look in to how to import certifications from third parties, as a means of controlling or compartmentalizing access to components of a dataset / project.





## Outline of approach





Currently there are a number of regulatory protocols and certifications  for research and data practices, including (among **many**):





- The [Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)](https://about.citiprogram.org/) program


- The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html)


- [Various institutional regulations (e.g. Institutional Review Boards (IRB) or other institutional protocols; [UT Austin](https://security.utexas.edu/policies/sensitive_research)]





In may cases the required trainings for these certifications are served or managed by online platforms like [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) or [CITI](https://about.citiprogram.org/), and are digitally transferred and recorded by consumer institutions.  Given that there appear to be systems in place to **digitally and automatedly** manage and administrate these certifications it seems that it may be quite technically feasible to incorporate these in the brainlife ecosystem.





### Foreseen challenges





#### Lack of obvious APIs


A quick check of CITI reveals [this page](https://webservices.citiprogram.org/), which provides some documentation of some forthcoming tools and methods which could facilitate this process.  Beyond this there doesn't appear to be much in the way of per-packaged approaches to this.





#### Lack of central protocol


While it is true that many institutions appear to be using the same internal methods for serving and documenting training compliance (i.e. Canvas), it's not clear that there is any standardization of these internal records that would permit the coordination, transfer, or updating of such information with 3rd parties (i.e. brainlife). 





#### Lack of standard certification 


Although federal and state regulations require that research institutions ensure and maintain compliance with ethical / security / procedural regulations, the specific means by which this is implemented aren't explicitly dictated or standardized.  As such institutions (and their respective IRBs) are at their discretion insofar as how they actually do this.  This means that different organizations, even in the same state or perhaps even in the same institutional system, may have different standards and methods for establishing and assessing certification.





##### Certification standardization sidenote


There's reason to believe that this ""wild west"" approach may be drawing to a close.  Europe's [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) is indicative to a more centralized and top-down approach to data security and compliance.  The existence of a standard like this would seem to permit the subsequent development of standardized certification procedures / protocols.  In the US there is [an ongoing push for data protection standards of this sort](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/), (also described [here](https://iapp.org/news/a/federal-data-privacy-regulation-is-on-the-way-thats-a-good-thing/)), which could similarly lay the groundwork for a standardized certification criterion.  Legislation of this sort will likely take several more years, but it may be worthwhile to be an early-adopter / path-forger in this domain.





## Tentative proposal 


Given that the scope (in that the infrastructure likely needed is non-trivial) and impact (in that such capabilities would be useful to other groups like [datalad](https://www.datalad.org/), [OpenNEURO](https://openneuro.org/), etc), it may be more appropriate to pursue this as part of a consortium or larger grant proposal (like this expired(?) [NIH Request for information](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-157.html)). In such a case it would probably be advisable to narrow the scope of this to the domain of neuromingaging data even though the methods/protocols developed would likely be easily adapted for other contexts. 





## Future extension


A similar process may also be appropriate for documenting / certifying the security and access characteristics of [compute resources](https://brainlife.io/resources).  Indeed, this may actually be a more tractable possibility, as the (currently( limited number of these systems would likely allow us to manually curate and codify these properties.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

I needed to add GDPR accept cookie, [standard official implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/gdpr?view=aspnetcore-6.0).





Using:





- NET 6.0


- Piranha 10.0.2 (every package)


- Firefox 98.0.1


- Edge 99.0.1150.46


- Brave 1.36.119 Chromium: 99.0.4844.83





When I go to the website, I can click accept GDPR cookie, it shows up in browser's cookie list with accepted status. Working as intended.





When I go to the manager, I can log in, read, open everything. But every POST inside the manager returns `400 bad request`. Removing the GDPR cookie config from Startup fixes the issue.





```C#


options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.Unspecified;


Edge: works


Brave: bad request


Firefox: bad request


```


all other options, including `options.HttpOnly =  HttpOnlyPolicy.None` and `options.Secure = CookieSecurePolicy.Always` or any mix or other modes of the three don't work at all.





Log from Edge:


```

```





Noticed the issue https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core/issues/1829, but I'm using the latest Piranha.





## Steps to reproduce:





1. dotnet new piranha.razor


2. add to `ConfigureServices`


```C#


            services.Configure<CookiePolicyOptions>(options =>


            {


                // Sets the display of the Cookie Consent banner (/Pages/Shared/_CookieConsentPartial.cshtml).


                // This lambda determines whether user consent for non-essential cookies is needed for a given request.


                options.CheckConsentNeeded = context => true;


                options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.Strict;


            });


```


add `UseCookiePolicy()` to `Configure`


```C#


            // Configure Tiny MCE


            EditorConfig.FromFile(""editorconfig.json"");





            app.UseCookiePolicy();





            // Middleware setup


            app.UsePiranha(options => {


                options.UseManager();


                options.UseTinyMCE();


                options.UseIdentity();


            });


```


3. Go to manager, try saving/publishing a page





it doesn't matter if the GDPR cookie is accepted, since the manager should be marked essential Piranha 10.0.1 and newer?


I feel like I'm missing something obvious... Do I need to add it via `options.Services.AddCookiePolicy` and `options.Builder.UseCookiePolicy().Build()` or something now?

-   Python 3.7 and higher


-   run `python3 -m pip install --user -r news/requirements.txt`





# Release candidate (Friday of VS Code endgame week, XXX XX)





-   [x] Review [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_componentGovernance/191876) (Click on ""microsoft/vscode-jupyter"" on that page) and resolve all High/Severe issues.





    -   [x] Manually add any repository dependencies (if you can't add manually, refer [here](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/cg/features/cgmanifest/)). Only add a cgmanifest.json if the components are not NPM or are not dev only.


-   [x] Create new release branch with format `release/release-YYYY.MM.100`


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `release/release-YYYY.MM` for changes


    -   [x] Run `npm install` to verify `package-lock.json` did not get updated.


    -   [x] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


        -   [x] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/tree/main/news) (typically `python news --final --update CHANGELOG.md | code-insiders -`)


        -   [x] Copy over the ""Thanks"" section from the previous release into the ""Thanks"" section for the new release


        -   [x] Make sure the ""Thanks"" section is up-to-date (e.g. compare to versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/requirements.txt))


        -   [x] Touch up news entries (e.g. add missing periods)


        -   [x] Check the Markdown rendering to make sure everything looks good


    -   [x] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) as appropriate. This file is manually edited so you can check with the teams if anything needs to be added here.


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `release/release-YYYY.MM`


-   [x] Update the [`release` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/branches)


    -   [x] If there are `release` branches that are two versions old (e.g. release-2020.[current month - 2]) you can delete them at this time (you would have to un-protect the release branches temporarily to delete them).


-   [x] Update `main` after creating the release branch. (Warning: this should happen right after creating the release branch. If this is deferred till later, the `main` and `release` branches can diverge significantly, which may cause merge conflicts.)


    -   [x] Merge the changes from release (Changelog, delete news, ThirdPartyNotices) into `main` branch


    -   [x] Bump the version number to the next monthly (""YYYY.M.100"") release in the `main` branch


        - If latest is `2022.2.100`, them bump it to `2022.3.100`,


        - This ensures the new new pre-release targets the next version.


        -   [x] `package.json`


        -   [x] `package-lock.json`


        -   [x] Confirm the 3rd part of the version ends with `100`.


    -   [x] Update the VS Code engine version in package.json (for release version) to target the upcoming stable release. This will allow us to release before VS Code and be ready in the marketplace. [Example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/pull/9494/files)


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `main`


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `main`


-   [x] GDPR bookkeeping (@greazer) (ðŸ¤–; Notes in OneNote under Python VS Code -> Dev Process -> GDPR)


-   [x] Open appropriate [documentation issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apython)


    -   new features


    -   settings changes


    -   etc. (ask the team)


-   [x] Release notes from VS Code have something about Jupyter


    -   Example doc update [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/5256)


-   [x] Schedule a sanity test. Aim for close after freeze so there is still time to fix release bugs before release. Ask teams before bash for specific areas that need testing.


-   [x] Is the validation pipeline clear? If not, drive to make sure that it is clear for release. Sanity test can be used to help with this.


-   [x] Ask CTI to test the release candidate





# Testing (Monday of VS Code release week, XXX XX)





-  [x] Obtain VS Code [prebuild](https://builds.code.visualstudio.com/builds/stable) for sanity testing


-  [x] Sanity test release candidate VSIX against VS Code prebuild


   -   Make sure that the sanity test hits both macOS and Windows builds


-  [x] Candidate bug fixes found from sanity test should be checked into `main` and cherry-picked to `release` branch





# Release (Tuesday or day before VS Code publishes, whichever is later)





## Preparation





-   [x] Make sure the [appropriate pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls) for the release notes(https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/v<vscode version>.md, make note of the branch and file name).


    - [x] Include all new new features under a section named `Jupyter` with screenshots or animated gifs.


    - [x] Fixes, code health should remain in the Jupyter change log.


-   [x] Make sure [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_componentGovernance/191876) is happy


-   [x] Make sure there is nothing targeting this release that still needs to be validated


        (`is:issue sort:updated-desc milestone:""<milestone>"" label:verification-needed -label:verified`)





## Release





-   [x] Publish the release


    -   [x] Verify the PR Pipeline on Github actions is green against the release branch.


    -   [x] Manually run the [Stable pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_build?definitionId=284) against the `release/release-xxxx.xx` branch


    -   [x] Approve the `Publish` stage


    -   [x] For manual (if needed as automatic should be tried first)


    -   [x] Go to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases and add a new release


        -   [x] Tag is version number


        -   [x] Branch is release branch


        -   [x] Copy contents of release branch changelog into the release (just copy the markdown)


        -   [x] Publish


-   [x] Determine if a hotfix is needed


    -   [x] Ensure the version in package.json is updated as follows:


        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.100`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.110`


        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.110`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.120`





# Day of VS Code publishing (Wednesday, XXX XX)


-   [x] Go through [`info needed` issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3Ainfo-needed) and close any that have no activity for over a month (ðŸ¤–)


-   [x] GDPR bookkeeping (ðŸ¤–) ((@greazer does regular classification every Monday evening))


-   [x] If any steps were unclear or changed in this release plan please update the `release_plan.md` file to make it clear for the next release





# Day of VS Code releasing the next insider version (Wednesday, XXX XX)


-   [x] Bump the engines.vscode version on the `main` branch to point to the next insider version. For example, from `1.58.0-insider` to `1.59.0-insider`

### Blindsend


<!--- Replace what's between ""<"" and "">"" --->


* [Blindsend](https://github.com/blindnet-io/blindsend) - Open source tool for private, end-to-end encrypted file exchange.


* **License**: MIT Licence


* **Why do you think this helps users privacy?**: Many users still use e-mail or non-encrypted file-transfer services to exchange sensitive (and often confidential) files. Even professionals (lawyers, doctors) request personal and sensitive data from their clients to be sent by e-mail. Blindsend encrypts files in the browser, before they reach the internet. It is easy to use, even for non-technical users. The parties exchanging files can remain anonimous.


* **Under what section should this service be listed?**: File Management and Sharing


* **Additional comments / info**: In the EU, thanks to the [Article 32 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/) it is illegal for professionals (such as lawyers, doctors, etc.) to request sensitive personal information to be sent to them in non-secure ways (such as e-mail). In France, failure to comply with this obligation can get professionals fined up to 300.000 EUR and 5 years of jail time, see [Art. 226-17 of French Criminal law](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/les-sanctions-penales).





So it is very important for professionals in EU to move away from e-mail and wetransfer, and adopt services listed here. Blindsend is our contribution to making a step in the right direction.


<!--- If you want to list more than one service on this same issue, use the same format as above for each service. --->",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

The API can also be queried for sites and returns known redirects (https://api.zcxv.icu/b2s.php?q=get&url=...). Some thoughts about this:





* I think it's dubious that users are not made aware, that all matched pages they are visiting are logged. what other data (IP address, the like) is logged?

# Code4Me


Code4Me provides automatic intelligent code completion based on large pre-trained language models. Code4Me predicts statement (line) completion and is available for both PyCharm (also other JetBrains IDEs) and Visual Studio Code. The code suggestions from Code4Me can be recognised by the logo in the suggestion menu. Code4Me automatically triggers (on specific trigger characters) or the user can prompt it manually by pressing the keybind. The keybind differs per IDE:





- Jetbrains: **ALT + SHIFT + K**


- VSC: **CTRL + SPACE**





Code4Me does not hinder native auto completion or other extensions.





## Installation


The plugin is available on both marketplaces. You can download them by either clicking the link in your browser or looking up 'Code4Me' in the integrated marketplace of your IDE.





### JetBrains


The Code4Me plugin can be found in the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19200-code4me).





### VSC


The Code4Me plugin can be found in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Code4Me.code4me-plugin).





## Data Collection


The plugin works with a remote API in order to suggest autocompletions. After triggering the autocompletion (automatically or manually), the client's request is sent to the server. Running the ML-based model, the server returns a prediction in response to the client. The remote API requires a segment of the current document (close left context at the trigger point). This limited segment is sent to the backend server only for prediction and will not be stored on our server. 


For the purpose of evaluating the models' predictions, we only store the suggestion made by the ML-based models at each trigger point and compare it against the accepted prediction by users (collected after 30 seconds). 





The plugin does not collect personal data nor the segment sent. The plugin does collect the following data:





* Suggest autocompletion.


* Verification of the autocompletion.


  * The plugin tracks the line the code was inserted and sends that line to the server after 30 seconds.


* Inference time of completion.





Furthermore, Code4Me is in full compliance with the GDPR and all data is anonymous. The data collected will remain on the servers of TU Delft until the end of the study. By using Code4Me you give permission for the data collection.

In contact menu you need captcha and gdpr sometimes but not always.

https://github.com/ifsnop/mysqldump-php/issues/251,1345087911.00000000000,16,0,0,N/A,N/A,We created a new new fork,"Our fork is here https://github.com/druidfi/mysqldump-php and can be used with Composer as it's also in Packagist.





We have now first stable release there: `1.0.0`





## Background





- We love this library and we use it for GDPR-related activities around databases for our customers


- We have 2 other libraries which use this (and which are also forks)


- https://github.com/druidfi/gdpr-mysqldump which uses `mysqldump-php` and adds GDPR-functionality: anonymize, clean etc.


- https://github.com/druidfi/drush-gdpr-dumper which uses ^^ to create Drush CLI command for Drupal 9 projects we use quite a lot





## What we did





- As we see that there was not much activity for ~2 years, we decided to fork the library and basically have somekind of continuity for our projects - so out toolset can be even installed when other constraints are going forward


- We wanna have everything running on supported PHP versions so that was first thing to do


- We broke the classes to their own files and did much type castings, codestyle fixes and cleanup





All the changes can be seen here as a draft PR: #253





## TODO





- We need to figure out what `test.sh` and `test.php` should be doing so those could be updated. We can already run them locally and in Github Actions but don't understand the results < **I'd really like some insight here** â¤ï¸  âœ… 


- Maybe drop sqlite support - cannot see much task about it here? âœ… 


- Later this year, drop support for PHP 7 and add support for PHP 8.2


- Going through PRs in this repo to see if there is something to include

-   Python 3.7 and higher


-   run `python3 -m pip install --user -r news/requirements.txt`





# Get the build green (Early in endgame week)





- [x] Ensure that any CI test failures have issues assigned to that area's owner.


- [x] Drive the build to green by fixing/disabling tests or pinging area owners to do so.





# Move open issues (Tuesday of VS Code endgame week, XXX XX)





- [x] Ask the team to move all open issues to next milestone or remove milestone and put back in triage. This allows endgame champ to have a better understanding of done state.


- [x] Schedule a bugbash if needed.





# Release candidate (Friday of VS Code endgame week, XXX XX)





-   [x] Review [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_componentGovernance/191876) (Click on ""microsoft/vscode-jupyter"" on that page) and resolve all High/Severe issues.





    -   [x] Focus on resolving `Critical` and `High` priority issues as others will be addressed in the `debt` week.


    -   [x] Manually add any repository dependencies (if you can't add manually, refer [here](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/cg/features/cgmanifest/)). Only add a cgmanifest.json if the components are not NPM or are not dev only.


        Instructions on updating `npm` dependencies in `package.json` & `package-lock.json` can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Resolving-Component-Governance-and-Dependabot-issues-(updating-package-lock.json)).


-   [x] Create new release branch with format `release/release-YYYY.MM.100`


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `release/release-YYYY.MM.100` for changes


    -   [x] Bump the vscode engine version in package.json


    -   [x] Run `npm install` to verify `package-lock.json` did not get updated aside from the vscode engine version.


        -   If there are minor changes, they can be just be updated in the release branch and later ported back to main.


    -   [x] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


        -   [x] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/tree/main/news) (typically `python news --final --update CHANGELOG.md | code-insiders -`)


        -   [x] Update the date at the top to when the release is planned.


        -   [x] Copy over the ""Thanks"" section from the previous release into the ""Thanks"" section for the new release


        -   [ ] Make sure the ""Thanks"" section is up-to-date (e.g. compare to versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/requirements.txt))


        -   [x] Touch up news entries (e.g. add missing periods)


        -   [x] Check the Markdown rendering to make sure everything looks good


    -   [x] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) as appropriate. This file is manually edited so you can check with the teams if anything needs to be added here.


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `release/release-YYYY.MM.100`


-   [x] Update the [`release` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/branches)


    -   [x] If there are `release` branches that are two versions old (e.g. `release-2020.[current month - 2].100`) you can delete them at this time (you would have to un-protect the release branches temporarily to delete them).


-   [x] Update `main` after creating the release branch. (Warning: this should happen right after creating the release branch. If this is deferred till later, the `main` and `release` branches can diverge significantly, which may cause merge conflicts.)


    -   [x] Merge the changes from release (Changelog, delete news, ThirdPartyNotices) into `main` branch


    -   [x] Bump the version number to the next monthly (""YYYY.M.100"") release in the `main` branch


        - If latest is `2022.2.100`, them bump it to `2022.3.100`,


        - This ensures the new new pre-release targets the next version.


        -   [x] `package.json`


        -   [x] `package-lock.json`


        -   [x] Confirm the 3rd part of the version ends with `100`.


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `main`


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `main`

    -   etc. (ask the team)


-   [ ] Release notes from VS Code have something about Jupyter


    -   Example doc update [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/5256)


-   [ ] Schedule a sanity test. Aim for close after freeze so there is still time to fix release bugs before release. Ask teams before bash for specific areas that need testing.


-   [x] Ensure that closed issues targeting this release will be verfied, asking for verification steps if needed. Sanity test can be used to help with this.

    - [ ] Include all new new features under a section named `Jupyter` with screenshots or animated gifs.


    - [ ] Fixes, code health should remain in the Jupyter change log.


-   [ ] Make sure [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_componentGovernance/191876) is happy


-   [ ] Make sure there is nothing targeting this release that still needs to be validated

    -   [ ] Approve the `Publish` stage


    -   [ ] Check if the release was automatically published here, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases - If not, publish manually: (This has been required since the move to az pipelines)


        -   [ ] Add a new release at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases


            -   Tag is version number


            -   Branch is release branch


            -   Copy contents of release branch changelog into the release (just copy the markdown)


        -   [ ] Publish


-   [ ] Determine if a hotfix is needed


    -   [ ] Ensure the version in package.json is updated as follows:

- [X] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.


- [X] The issue still exists against the latest stable version of Elementor.





### Description





It seems Elementor is loading a Google Font in the Wordpress backend:


`<link rel='stylesheet' id='elementor-admin-top-bar-fonts-css'  href='[https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&#038;display=swap&#038;ver=3.7.8](view-source:https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap&ver=3.7.8)' media='all' />`





a) This is unnecessary â€“ the WP backend already has a font.


b) Just loading Google Fonts is not GDPR compliant.


c) It is loaded even on non-Elementor pages!





### Steps to reproduce





Install Elementor. Look at backend HTML output.





### Isolating the problem





- [X] This bug happens with only Elementor plugin active (and Elementor Pro).


- [X] This bug happens with a Blank WordPress theme active ([Hello theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/)).


- [X] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.

Matomo currently supports the Do-Not-Track-Header that was introduced by some browser years ago. The option to exclude visitors sending this header is even enabled by default.





In 2019 W3C closed the group that was working on the DNT standard and though this is meanwhile deprecated.





Safari [removed the support for DNT](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-12_1-release-notes#Security-and-Privacy) for privacy reasons shorty after that in version 12.1.





In matter of GDPR the DNT header does also not need to be respected.

Fixes #2884 





- As discussed in Issue #2884, I added the [Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook) as a resource to the Resources subchapter of Managing Sensitive Data Projects.


- I also proposed some minor tweaks to two other subchapters in Managing Sensitive Data Projects.





### List of changes proposed in this PR (pull-request)





- Add Data Privacy Handbook to `project-design/sdpm/resources.md`


- Add more GDPR-like language to the `project-design/sdpm/informed.md` subchapter. The GDPR has some more specific requirements which are now a bit clearer.


- In the `project-design/sdpm/data-privacy-strategies.md`:


  - Removed the part that said ""while limiting the loss of information"": you always lose information when anonymising data


  - Expanded the Access permissions part and the part on Data transfer

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe





<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->





Hi, I wanted to setup an analytics service. I found this blog post on how to set Google Page View.


https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/enable-google-pv/





This solution however requires the use of Google Analytics, which comes with the following terms and conditions on privacy.


I don't think jekyll or jekyll-theme-chirpy are complying with this policy by default. There is no cookie consent banner on the template. Nor there is a disclosure on the data collection and processing.





> You must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies, identifiers for mobile devices (e.g., Android Advertising Identifier or Advertising Identifier for iOS) or similar technology used to collect data. You must disclose the use of Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes data. This can be done by displaying a prominent link to the site â€œHow Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or appsâ€, (located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), or any other URL that Google may provide from time to time). You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a User is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the Userâ€™s device where such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law.


 


More info from [another source](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-google-analytics/). 





> Google Analytics stores [cookies](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/cookies/) on your users' PCs to keep track of usage data. This is enough to evoke the requirement of a Privacy Policy according to the [EU Cookies Directive](https://termsfeed.com/blog/eu-cookies-directive/). The EU's [GDPR](https://termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr/) also requires a Privacy Policy when usage data is collected, such as through cookies.





This is the problem I have. I wish to use an analytics service while remaining compliant to their privacy terms :)





## Describe the solution you'd like





<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->





I would really like to be able to use a GDPR compliant analytics service. [This PostHog tool](https://posthog.com/) seems like a good alternative. With that (or with another GPDR compliant tool ([here is a list of 13 tools](https://posthog.com/blog/best-gdpr-compliant-analytics-tools))) there will be no need to integrate a cookie banner.





A blog post on how to configure the jekyll-theme-chirpy with one of these tools would be fantastic :rocket: 





## Describe alternatives you've considered





<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->





* If Google Analytics is to be used, then the cookie banner as well as the disclosure need be integrated in the template.


* Very basic but still can display views for each page: https://countapi.xyz/

I'm left with an error, which looks like its something to do with Amazon to me, but no real clue? ( the error was also there when the prebid warning, no gpp cmp found was being thrown, when the gpp consent setting we're in)

Closes Automattic/Martech#1681

## Proposed Changes

* We'd like to add more information to the Facebook/Meta tracking pixel, e.g. bill period.
* Removes the joined string of product_slugs, and instead adds them in an array. This makes it easier to ""pick up"" product slugs and other info in the Meta Ads Manager (hopefully).

## Testing Instructions
* Sandbox store
* Allow ad-tracking and allow advertising via the cookie banner (if you're in GDPR). E.g. by changing the config/development.json file, or adding `?flags=ad-tracking` to the URL.
* You can add a `debugger` statement inside the `containsWpcomProducts` conditonal in `recordOrderInFacebook`, and verify that the array get's populated, or just monitor in the network console. Once the payment is complete, you should see this data being sent to Facebook
* (We need to verify that the Facebook analytics panel is picking up this meta data). 

Expected data for a Business plan with a bundled domain:

BuildingIDâ€™s that are queried for the first time can currently be retrieved when one has access to the webservice. When new data becomes available on FunderMaps' side for a BuildingID that was previously queried by the client,  the client requesting the new data also.

For this purpose a registration needs to be maintained on FunderMaps' side.
Considerations are:

It is not possible with respect to contracts and GDPR to register customer's properties.
The customer needs to know which properties have received new data in some way. For example, by making a call that returns a list of properties that were previously requested but have new data. This list contains the BAG property ID, which the customer can use to query the webservice again. No insight is provided into what data has changed.",GDPR,GDPR,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/pull/1043,1694099432.00000000000,0,0,0,N/A,N/A,feat: encrypt PII fields before saving it in the database,"## Type of Change
<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->
- [x] New feature

## Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
This PR adds support for encrypting PII fields in following tables
- MerchantAccount
- MerchantConnectorAccount
- Address
- Customer

Here's how the basic flow goes, the main encryption key `master_key` will be encrypted with KMS and configured in `development.toml`. For every merchant we will create seperate encryption key and encrypt that key with `master_key` and push it to the database and we will use that key to encrypt the PII fields.

This PR also has migration script that will migrate currently decrypted database to encrypted database.

### Additional Changes
- [x] This PR modifies the database schema
- [x] This PR modifies application configuration/environment variables

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  

I was surprised to see that an open source project running locally as a demo was sending analytics data to Google.

**Describe the solution you'd like**  

`enable_analytics` should be an option that defaults to **do not track analytics**. A user should explicitly opt-into this behavior rather than have to opt out.

**Additional context**  

The opt-in default is implemented here:

https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/v3.30.0/gradio/blocks.py#L686-L687

Apart from the unconventional use of `True` as an environment variable to signal true/yes/on (it's more common to use `1`), environment variables should default to ""user did not specify this value"".

I think it's perfectly acceptable and to enable the collection of data by way of a public server (e.g. a hosted version of a gradio app) but it is not acceptable IMO to track data running locally without an explicit opt-in from the user.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

Of course he could also use the acount to send SPAM mails.

I therefore was forced to create my own REST API utilizing tokens I can easily revoke that is called by the website. The service then actually calls the listmonk API. If the website is hacked the only thing the user can do is send opt-in mails and subscribe or unsubscribe e-mail addresses - he can't even get access to the full list of users as I didn't implement that method on purpose.

Therefore instead of adding multi-user support I'd rather see token authentication for the API as an additional way of authentication. That should be quite easy to implement.",GDPR,GDPR,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

* Even though the UK has left the EU as of January 2021, the GDPR was already in effect and remains a valid UK law.

Having regard to Article 70(1)(n) and Articles 40 and 41 of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter â€œGDPRâ€),
Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018,
Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018,
HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION:
1 INTRODUCTION
1. Regulation 2016/6791 (â€œthe GDPRâ€) came into effect on 25 May 2018. One of the main objectives of the GDPR is to provide a consistent level of data protection throughout the European Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market.2 The GDPR also introduces the principle of accountability, which places the onus on data controllers to be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation.3 The provisions under Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR in respect of codes of conduct (â€œcodesâ€) represent a practical, potentially cost effective and meaningful method to achieve greater levels of consistency of protection for data protection rights. Codes can act as a mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.4 Notably, they can help to bridge the harmonisation gaps that may exist between Member States in their application of data protection law.5 They also provide an opportunity for particular sectors to reflect upon common data processing activities and to agree to bespoke and practical data protection rules, which will meet the needs of the sector as well as the requirements of the GDPR.6
1 The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.
2 See Recital 13 of the GDPR.
3 See Article 5(2) of the GDPR.
4 See for example Articles 24(3) and 28(5) and 32(3). A code of conduct may also be used by data processors to demonstrate sufficient guarantees that their processing is compliant with the GDPR (See Article 28(5)).
5 See Recitals 77, 81, 98, 99, 148, 168 and Articles 24, 28, 35, 40, 41, 46, 57, 64, 70 of the GDPR. This is particularly the case where a code relates to processing activities in several Member States.
6 Codes do not necessarily need to be confined or limited to a specific sector. For example, a code could apply to separate sectors who have a common processing activity which share the same processing characteristics and needs. Where a code is cross-sectoral in its application, more than one monitoring body may be appointed under that code. However, where this is the case the code should make it absolutely clear as to the scope of that monitoring bodyâ€™s functions, in other words by specifying the sectors in respect of which each monitoring body will perform its functions under Article 41 and the oversight mechanisms available to each monitoring body. In this regard, the relevant sections of these guidelines which set out the responsibilities, obligations and
 **Adopted 5**

2. Member States, Supervisory Authorities, the European Data Protection Board (â€œthe Boardâ€) and the European Commission (â€œthe Commissionâ€) are obliged to encourage the drawing up of codes to contribute to the proper application of the Regulation.7 These guidelines will support and facilitate â€œcode ownersâ€ in drafting, amending or extending codes.
1.1 Scope of these guidelines
3. The aim of these guidelines is to provide practical guidance and interpretative assistance in relation to the application of Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR. They are intended to help clarify the procedures and the rules involved in the submission, approval and publication of codes at both a National and European level. They intend to set out the minimum criteria required by a Competent Supervisory Authority (â€œCompSAâ€) before accepting to carry out an in depth review and evaluation of a code.8 Further, they intend to set out the factors relating to the content to be taken into account when evaluating whether a particular code provides and contributes to the proper and effective application9 of the GDPR. Finally, they intend to set out the requirements for the effective monitoring of compliance with a code.10
4. These guidelines should also act as a clear framework for all CompSAs, the Board and the Commission to evaluate codes in a consistent manner and to streamline the procedures involved in the assessment process. This framework should also provide greater transparency, ensuring that code owners who intend to seek approval for a code are fully conversant with the process and understand the formal requirements and the appropriate thresholds required for approval.
5. Guidance on codes of conduct as a tool for transfers of data as per Article 40(3) of the GDPR will be considered in separate guidelines to be issued by the EDPB.
6. All codes previously approved11 will need to be reviewed and re-evaluated in line with the requirements of the GDPR and then resubmitted for approval as per the requirements of Articles 40 and 41 and as per the procedures outlined in this document.
2 DEFINITIONS
â€˜Accreditationâ€™ refers to the ascertainment that the proposed monitoring body meets the requirements set out in Article 41 of the GDPR to carry out the monitoring of compliance with a code of conduct. This check is undertaken by the supervisory authority where the code is

submitted for approval (Article 41(1)). The accreditation of a monitoring body applies only for a specific code.12
â€˜Code Ownersâ€™ refers to associations or other bodies who draw up and submit their code13 and they will have an appropriate legal status as required by the code and in line with national law. â€˜CompSAâ€™ refers to the Supervisory Authority which is competent as per Article 55 of the GDPR. â€˜Monitoring bodyâ€™ refers to a body/committee or a number of bodies/committees (internal or external to the code owners14) who carry out a monitoring function to ascertain and assure that the code is complied with as per Article 41.
â€˜Concerned SAsâ€™ shall have the same meaning as per Article 4(22) of the GDPR
â€˜National codeâ€™ refers to a code which covers processing activities contained in one Member State. â€˜Transnational codeâ€™ refers to a code which covers processing activities in more than one Member State.
3 WHATARECODES?
7. GDPR codes are voluntary accountability tools which set out specific data protection rules for categories of controllers and processors. They can be a useful and effective accountability tool, providing a detailed description of what is the most appropriate, legal and ethical set of behaviours of a sector. From a data protection viewpoint, codes can therefore operate as a rulebook for controllers and processors who design and implement GDPR compliant data processing activities which give operational meaning to the principles of data protection set out in European and National law.
8. Trade associations or bodies representing a sector can create codes to help their sector comply with the GDPR in an efficient and potentially cost effective way. As provided by the non-exhaustive list contained in Article 40(2) of the GDPR, codes of conduct may notably cover topics such as:
ï‚· fair and transparent processing;
ï‚· legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts;
ï‚· the collection of personal data; the pseudonymisation of personal data;
ï‚· the information provided to individuals and the exercise of individualsâ€™ rights;
ï‚· the information provided to and the protection of children (including mechanisms for
obtaining parental consent);
ï‚· technical and organisational measures, including data protection by design and by default and
security measures;
ï‚· breach notification;
ï‚· data transfers outside the EU; or
ï‚· dispute resolution procedures.
12 However, a monitoring body may be accredited for more than one code provided it satisfies the requirements for accreditation.
13 As per Recital 98 of the GDPR.
14 See also Paragraphs 64â€“ 67 below.
 **Adopted 7**

9. The GDPR in repealing the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) provides more specific and detailed provisions around codes, the requirements which need to be met and the procedures involved in attaining approval, as well as their registration, publication and promotion once approved. Those provisions, in conjunction with these guidelines, will help encourage code owners to have a direct input into the establishment of data protection standards and rules for their processing sectors.
10. It is important to note that codes are one of a number of voluntary tools that can be used from a suite of data protection accountability tools which the GDPR offers, such as Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)15 and Certification.16 They are a mechanism which can be used to assist organisations in demonstrating their compliance with the GDPR.17
4 WHATARETHEBENEFITSOFCODES?
11. Codes represent an opportunity to establish a set of rules which contribute to the proper application of the GDPR in a practical, transparent and potentially cost effective manner that takes on board the nuances for a particular sector and/or its processing activities. In this regard codes can be drawn up for controllers and processors taking account of the specific characteristics of processing carried out in certain sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises.18 They have the potential to be an especially important and beneficial tool for both SMEs and micro enterprise businesses19 by providing a mechanism which allows them to achieve data protection compliance in a more cost effective way.
 For example, micro enterprises involved in similar health research activities could come together via their relevant associations and collectively develop a code in respect of their collection and processing of health data rather than attempting to carry out such comprehensive data protection analysis on their own. Codes will also benefit supervisory authorities by allowing them to gain a better understanding and insight of the data processing activities of a specific profession, industry or other sector.
12. Codes can help controllers and processors to comply with the GDPR by governing areas such as fair and transparent processing, legitimate interests, security and data protection by design and default measures and controller obligations. Codes are accessible to all processing sectors and can
15 Codes of Conduct and Certification are voluntary accountability tools, whereas a DPIA will be mandatory in certain circumstances. For further information on other accountability tools please see the general guidance webpage of the EDPB (www.edpb.europa.eu).
16 See Article 42 of the GDPR and note the EDPB Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR.
17 Adherence to a code does not, of itself, guarantee compliance with the GDPR or immunity for controllers/processors from sanctions or liabilities provided under the GDPR.
18 See Recital 98 of the GDPR in respect of Article 40(1). For example, a code could be appropriately scaled to meet the requirement of micro organisations in addition to small and medium enterprises.
19 Article 40(1) of the GDPR in particular identifies codes as a solution to address the needs of such enterprises. 
**Adopted 8**
 
be drafted in as narrow or as wide-ranging a manner as is befitting that particular sector20, provided that the code contributes to the proper and effective application of the GDPR.21
 For example, approval could be sought for a set of rules in respect of how a specific charitable sector would ensure its processing arrangements were fair and transparent. Alternatively, the specific charitable sector could decide to draft a code, which incorporates and properly applies a multitude of different provisions under the GDPR to cover all their processing activities, from the lawful basis for the collection of personal data to the notification of personal data breaches.
13. Codes can provide a degree of co-regulation and they could decrease the level of reliance that controllers and processors may sometimes place upon data protection supervisory authorities to provide more granular guidance for their specific processing activities.
14. Codes can provide a degree of autonomy and control for controllers and processors to formulate and agree best practice rules for their given sectors. They can provide an opportunity to consolidate best practice processing operations in specific fields. They can also become a vital resource that businesses can rely upon to address critical issues in their processing procedures and to achieve better data protection compliance.
15. Codes can provide much needed confidence and legal certainty by providing practical solutions to problems identified by particular sectors in relation to common processing activities. They encourage the development of a collective and consistent approach to the data processing needs of a particular sector.
 20 Article 40(2) of the GDPR refers to codes being prepared by representative organisations of â€˜categories of controllers and processorsâ€™. Therefore this could include cross sector codes where practical provided the representativeness criteria is met.
21 A narrowly focused code must make it sufficiently clear to data subjects (and to the satisfaction of a CompSA) that controllers/processors adhering to the code does not necessarily ensure compliance with all of the legislation. An appropriate safeguard in this instance could be to ensure adequate transparency regarding the limited scope of the code to those signed up to the code and data subjects.
**Adopted 9**

16. Codes can be an effective tool to earn the trust and confidence of data subjects. They can address a variety of issues, many of which may arise from concerns of the general public or even perceived concerns from within the sector itself, and as such constitute a tool for enhancing transparency towards individuals regarding the processing of their personal data.
 For example, in the context of processing health data for research purposes, concerns over the appropriate measures to be adopted in order to promote compliance with the rules applying to the processing of sensitive health information could be allayed by the existence of an approved and detailed code. Such a code could outline in a fair and transparent manner the following:
ï‚· the relevant safeguards to be applied regarding the information to be provided to data subjects;
ï‚· relevant safeguards to be applied in respect of the data collected from third parties;
ï‚· communication or dissemination of the data;
ï‚· the criteria to be implemented to ensure respect for the principle of data
minimisation;
ï‚· the specific security measures;
ï‚· appropriate retention schedules; and
ï‚· the mechanisms to manage the data as a result of the exercise of data subjects'
rights (As per Articles 32 and 89 of the GDPR)
17. Codes may also provide to be a significant and useful mechanism in the area of international transfers. New provisions in the GDPR allow third parties to agree to adhere to approved codes in order to satisfy legal requirements to provide appropriate safeguards in relation to international transfers of personal data to third countries.22 Additionally, approved codes of this nature may result in the promotion and cultivation of the level of protection which the GDPR provides to the wider international community while also permitting sustainable legally compliant international transfers of personal data. They may also serve as a mechanism which further develops and fosters data subject trust and confidence in the processing of data outside of the European Economic Area.23
18. Approved codes have the potential to act as effective accountability tools for both processors and controllers. As outlined in Recital 77 and Article 24(3) of the GDPR, adherence to an approved code of conduct is envisaged, amongst others, as an appropriate method for a data controller or processor to demonstrate compliance with regard to specific parts or principles of the Regulation
22 See Article 40(2)(j) and Article 40(3) of the GDPR.
23 The Board will provide separate guidelines in relation to the use of codes as a mechanism to facilitate international transfers.
 **Adopted 10**

or the Regulation as a whole.24 Adherence to an approved code of conduct will also be a factor taken into consideration by supervisory authorities when evaluating specific features of data processing such as the security aspects25, assessing the impact of processing under a DPIA26 or when imposing an administrative fine.27 In case of a breach of one of the provisions of the Regulation, adherence to an approved code of conduct might be indicative of how comprehensive the need is to intervene with an effective, proportionate, dissuasive administrative fine or other corrective measure from the supervisory authority.28
5 ADMISSIBILITYOFADRAFTCODE29
19. There are a number of conditions to be met before a CompSA would be in a position to undertake to fully assess and review a code for the purposes of Article 40(5) of the GDPR. They aim to facilitate an efficient evaluation of any draft code. The following criteria apply:
5.1 Explanatory statement and supporting documentation
20. Every draft code which is submitted for approval must contain a clear and concise explanatory statement, which provides details as to the purpose of the code, the scope of the code30 and how it will facilitate the effective application of this Regulation.31 This will assist in expediting the process and in providing the requisite clarity to accompany a submission. The submission must also include supporting documentation, where relevant, to underpin the draft code and explanatory statement.32
5.2 Representative
21. A code must be submitted by an association/consortium of associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors (code owners) in accordance with Article 40(2). A non-exhaustive list of example of possible code owners would include: trade and representative associations, sectoral organisations, academic organisations and interest groups.
22. The code owners must demonstrate to the CompSA that they are an effective representative body and that they are capable of understanding the needs of their members and clearly defining the
24 See also Article 24(3) and 28(5) of the GDPR.
25 Article 32(3) of the GDPR.
26 Article 35(8) of the GDPR.
27 Article 83(2) (j) of the GDPR. Also note the application of codes in respect of WP 253/17 Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the Regulation 2016/679 which was adopted by the EDPB.
28 Ibid
29 This also applies for all codes (national and transnational) as well as amended or extended codes.
30 The following non-exhaustive categories may apply: identification of members, processing activity, data subjects, types of data, jurisdictions, concerned SAs (Article 4(22) of the GDPR).
31 This document provides an opportunity for code owners to demonstrate the rationale and basis for approval of their code. It provides a platform for code owners to outline the appropriateness of safeguards proposed and to demonstrate that proposed mechanisms are fit for purpose.
32 Examples could include a consultation summary, membership information or research that demonstrates a need for the code.

processing activity or sector to which the code is intended to apply. Depending on the definition and parameters of the sector concerned, representativeness can be derived amongst others from the following elements:
ï‚· Number or percentage of potential code members from the relevant controllers or processors in that sector;
ï‚· Experience of the representative body with regard to the sector and processing activities concerning the code.
Processing Scope
The draft code must have a defined scope that clearly and precisely determines the processing operations (or characteristics of the processing) of personal data covered by it, as well as the categories of controllers or processors it governs. This will include the processing issues that the code seeks to address and provide practical solutions.
Territorial scope
The draft code must specify whether it is a national or transnational code and provide details in relation to territorial scope, identifying all relevant jurisdictions to which it intends to apply. For any transnational codes (as well as amended or extended transnational codes), a list of concerned SAs must be included. Appendix 1 outlines the distinction between national and transnational codes.
Submission to a CompSA
The code owners must ensure that the supervisory authority chosen to review a draft code is competent in accordance with Article 55 of the GDPR.33 Appendix 2 provides further information which may assist code owners in choosing a CompSA for a transnational code.
Oversight of mechanisms
The draft code must propose mechanisms that allow for the monitoring of compliance with its provisions by stakeholders who undertake to apply it.34 This applies to both public and non-public sector codes.
Monitoring body
A draft code which involves processing activities of private, non-public authorities or bodies must also identify a monitoring body and contain mechanisms which enable that body to carry out its
   33 Article 55 of the GDPR states that each supervisory authority is competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to and the exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with the Regulation on the territory of its own Member State. Also see Recital 122 of the GDPR.

**Adopted 12**

functions as per Article 41 of the GDPR.35 The identified monitoring body or bodies must have the appropriate standing to meet the requirements of being fully accountable in their role.36 To this end, the monitoring body or bodies have to be accredited by the CompSA according to Article 41(1) of the GDPR.37
5.8 Consultation
28. A draft code must contain information as to the extent of consultation carried out. Recital 99 of the GDPR indicates when drafting a code (or amending/extending) a consultation should take place with the relevant stakeholders including data subjects, where feasible. As such, code owners should confirm and demonstrate that an appropriate level of consultation has taken place with the relevant stakeholders when submitting the code for approval. Where relevant, this will include information about other codes of conduct that potential code members may be subject to and reflect how their code complements other codes. This should also outline the level and nature of consultation which took place with their members, other stakeholders and data subjects or associations/bodies representing them.38 In practice, a consultation is highly recommended with the members forming part of the organisation or body acting as the code owner and also taking into account the processing activity with the clients of such members. Where no consultation has been carried out with regard to relevant and specific stakeholders due to the lack of feasibility, it will be a matter for the code owner to explain this position.
5.9 National legislation
29. Code owners must provide confirmation that the draft code is in compliance with relevant national legislation, in particular, where the code involves a sector which is governed by specific provisions set out in national law or it concerns processing operations that have to be assessed, taking into account specific re",,,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

**passwordless** means that the user can log in with a magic link without ever having a password.

**SSO** means single-sign-on (e.g. sign-in with Google)

<h2 id=""Examples-Risks-Assumptions"">Examples, Risks & Assumptions</h2>

1. *Explain concretely what will manifest as a result of this RFW.*

The ability for users to log in without a password.

2. *Explain how is it different from what is already manifesting i.e. what we already have?*

We don't have any way for users to log in.

3. *Explain what users/brands will experience as a result of this RFW. How will they feel as a result of it? How will they benefit as a result of it?*

Scenario A:

The user will come to the login screen. The user will then insert either their email address or phone number. They will then receive the magic link. The user clicks the link on their device. If the link is valid, the user then is allowed to come in.

Scenario B:

The user will come to the login screen. The user will click the SSO button of their choice. They will then go through the prompts of that SSO. If the sign-in is valid, the user then is allowed to come in.

4. *If applicable, provide sample messages for any new messages the system will display as a result of this RFW.*

This is available in the Figma mocks.

5. *Define what is out of scope in this request.*

The ability to create/delete/update user accounts.

6. *What are the data protection, privacy, and security assumptions made for this request (for example, should this be GDPR, compliant, etc)*

The system has to be a GDPR complaint.

7. *Explain how this user story will be supported (i.e. customer support - if the user story fails technically, how will the user be supported).*

There is no support function provided at this point.

8. *Explain how this user story impacts revenue or billing (if applicable).*

NA

9. *State any additional risks identified as a result of this user story.*

- Not following GDPR
- Not following security best practices
- Overcomplicating the actual build of this request

<h2 id=""success-metrics"">Success Metrics</h2>

The user is able to log in.

<h2 id=""conceptual-design"">Conceptual Design</h2>

The user is provided with two different ways to log in: 

- magic link
- SSO

<h2 id=""drawbacks"">Drawbacks</h2>
If the provider for the magic link has a problem, the user can't come in. This is why we provided SSO as a backup. 

<h2 id=""alternatives"">Alternatives</h2>

The alternative is to make either a password login or use just SSO. 

<h2 id=""new-data"">New Data</h2>

- User email AND/OR a user phone number

It's a directory of open source fonts, that are each hosted individually on NPM. 

https://github.com/fontsource/font-files

https://github.com/fontsource/font-files/tree/main/fonts/other/bravura

See directions for installing Bravura via NPM:
https://fontsource.org/fonts/bravura/install

We could try to use fontsource and make sure all the font files are the most up to date versions (I see their version of Bravura might be slightly outdated...).

Or we can take the same approach and publish all the vexflow compatible fonts as individual NPM packages.

Then a developer can run `npm install @vexflow-fonts/leland` to install the web font locally in their project. Then, when your project goes live, your bundler will put the font files on your own web server. Since it is self hosted, you can control the GDPR compliance.

ðŸ“‹ **Task Description**
The technical task at hand involves implementing Google Analytics into your website while ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Google Analytics is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into user behavior and website performance. However, because it involves the collection of user data, it's essential to implement it in a way that respects user privacy and complies with GDPR regulations.

ðŸ’¡ **Insights**
- Google Analytics provides an option to anonymize IP addresses by adding the following code snippet to the tracking code:
```js
ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);
```
- You can find resources and documentation on implementing Google Analytics and cookie consent banners on the Google Analytics and GDPR official websites.
ðŸ‘ **Acceptance Criteria**
-    The Google Analytics tracking code is successfully integrated into all website pages.
-    IP addresses are anonymized in the Google Analytics configuration.
 -   A cookie consent banner is displayed on the website, clearly informing users about the use of cookies, including Google Analytics cookies.
-    The cookie consent banner provides users with the option to accept or decline cookies and includes a link to the Privacy Policy.

ðŸ“ **Additional Notes**
 -   Make sure to thoroughly test the implementation to ensure that Google Analytics tracking is functioning correctly and that the cookie consent banner behaves as expected.
-    It's a good practice to document the implementation process and any changes made to the website for future reference.
-    Consider regularly reviewing and updating your website's privacy policy to reflect any changes in data processing practices.

## Removed Adapters

### Reason 1 - known to be deprecated or out of business

applogy, rhythmone, engagebdr

### Reason 2 - refusal to establish or confirm a working group contact email address
_The following adapters have an invalid email address (mail bounced) or have an individual contact rather than a group mailbox. The adapters were removed for being in violation of Global Module Rule 1 of the [Prebid Module Rules](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/module-rules.html#module-rules). Adapters are welcomed to return to the project at any time by providing an updated email address. If you need help restoring a removed adapter from the git history, please open a ticket and we'll be delighted to assist._

PBS-Go: kubient, nanointeractive, ninthdecimal
PBS-Java: definemedia, kubient, nanointeractive, ninthdecimal, yeahmobi

**Define Media and yeahmobi provided updated email addresses after PBS-Java 2.0 was released and before PBS-Go 2.0 was released. They will be added back to PBS-Java 2.x in the future.**

## Other Changes

- Case insensitive biddercodes (#2400 )

## PBS-Go Specific Changes

### JSON Encoding Library
The `encoding/json` package from the standard Go library is replaced by [JSON-Iterator](https://jsoniter.com/) in core code (not yet adapters), resulting in a 300% performance improvement for encoding/decoding OpenRTB payloads. We'll extend this change into adapters once the dust settles.

We tried to find a more performant library 100% compatible with the standard Go `encoding/json` package. Despite many claims, no such library exists. The closest we've found is JSON-Iterator.

There are some subtle changes we had to account for, such as a null `json.RawMessage` being represented as `nil` instead of previously as the literal characters ""null"". Error messages are different and harder to parse in the JSON-Iterator library. We've added a rather hacky translation which we hope to improve when JSON-Iterator error handling improves to look more like that of the standard library.

### Hard Coded Aliases

We've improved the setup of hardcoded aliases, streamlining the process to require just one configuration file and no code. Half of the aliases are migrated in 2.0 and rest will be migrated in 2.1.

### Remove Config Backwards Compatibility

In previous updates to Prebid Server 0.x, we've strived to preserve backward compatibility with deprecated configuration. In this release, we've discontinued this backward compatibility as part of a tech debt cleanup effort.

#### blacklisted_accts
Blacklisted accounts are removed. Please use the account configuration system instead. To deny access to specific accounts, enable `account_required` to `true` and configure a backend account data storage which can be either the local file system (with config deployed using Kubernetes) or HTTP call. Support for database MySQL and Postgres backends are in the works.

#### gdpr.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose

 `gdpr.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose` no longer supports a string and must now be specified as a bool indicating whether or not the purpose should be enforced. Previously, the enforcement algorithm for a given purpose could be specified through this field by setting it to ""full"", ""basic"" or ""none"". The enforcement algorithm should now be specified using `gdpr.purpose{1-10}.enforce_algo`.
 
 #### ccpa/gdpr.integration_enabled
 
This release removes backwards compatibility for deprecated host and account configuration options:
- `ccpa.integration_enabled`
- `gdpr.integration_enabled`

Instead, hosts should use `ccpa.channel_enabled` and `gdpr.channel_enabled` respectively in account configs.
For example:
```
""gdpr"": {
    ""channel_enabled"": {
      ""web"": true,
      ""app"": false,
      ""dooh"": true,
      ""amp"": false,
      ""video"": true
    }
}
```

#### {stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.postgres

The release removes support for the following host options:
`{stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.postgres.`
- `connection.dbname`
- `connection.host`
- `.connection.port`
- `.connection.user`
- `.connection.password`
- `.connection.query_string`
- `.connection.tls.root_cert`
- `.connection.tls.client_cert`
- `.connection.tls.client_key`
- `.fetcher.query`
- `.fetcher.amp_query`
- `.initialize_caches.timeout_ms`
- `.initialize_caches.query`
- `.initialize_caches.amp_query`
- `.poll_for_updates.refresh_rate_seconds`
- `.poll_for_updates.timeout_ms`
- `.poll_for_updates.query`
- `.poll_for_updates.amp_query`

Instead, hosts should use `.database` instead of `.postgres` when setting these fields.
e.g. `{stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.database.connection.dbname`.

It should also be noted that since we now need to use the generic `.database` in our path, we must also set the driver as such: `{stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.database.connection.driver`.

#### events_enabled

The host configuration `events_enabled` is removed. Instead, use `account_defaults.events.enabled` in the host config and `events.enabled` in account configs.

#### enable_gzip

The `enable_gzip` configuration value is removed. This controls if the host can respond with gzip'd payloads and has nothing to do with communication with bidders.  Instead, hosts should use `compression.response.enable_gzip`.

#### stored_requests.filesystem

The `stored_requests.filesystem` and `stored_requests.directorypath` values are removed. Instead, use 
 `stored_requests.filesystem.enabled` and `stored_requests.filesystem.path`, respectively.

#### gdpr.tcf2

- `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enabled` is replaced by `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose`.
- `gdpr.tcf2.purpose_one_treatement.*` is replaced by `gdpr.tcf2.purpose_one_treatment.*`, fixing a typo.
- `gdpr.tcf2.special_purpose1.*` is replaced by `gdpr.tcf2.special_feature1.*`, changing the word purpose to feature to better match the TCF2 spec.

String data type support for `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose` is removed. This field must now be specified as a bool. Previously, the enforcement algorithm for a given purpose could be specified through this field by setting it to ""full"", ""basic"" and ""none"". This should now be specified using `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enforce_algo`.

#### usersync_url

The adapter `usersync_url` configuration value is removed. This used to be the only way to configure a user sync url before we refactored and introduced usersync config. Hosts may have needed to override this value to enable user sync for some bidders. The backwards compatibility was limited to adapters which supported either iframe or redirect usersync, but not both.

Instead, please use the `userSync.iframe.url` and or `userSync.redirect.url` config of the new adapter `usersync` config.",GDPR,GDPR,N/A,purpose limitation,N/A,0

Scientific Python offered us to use their plausible instance for our website analytics. [Plausible](https://plausible.io) self-describes as

> No cookies and fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR

and should hopefully gain us some insights into our users in a privacy-friendly manner.

Documentation for the inclusion in our theme can be found here: https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/analytics.html

I am not yet sure how and who will be able to access the reports at https://views.scientific-python.org but @stefanv would know more.

After adding this we could also think about adding it to our main page and possibly shoehorn into our old HTML docs. Not sure if the latter is worth it though. I am mainly interested in which part of our documentation get accessed most or least.

Add a setting for a URL that can be used as the action URL on a custom POST form. Such a form can be nearly fully controlled by a custom Django component and template, except for the action URL. MailChimp and potentially other services can generate an action URL, but since it contains unique IDs related to a single MailChimp account, I don't want to commit it with the template and would rather store it in the database.

As an example, with MailChimp, the user is taken to a form where they enter other details like name and institution, as configured via MailChimp. They then have to pass a captcha and agree to terms before signing up. Note that MailChimp offers the option to configure GDPR settings.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A less intelligent link to a signup form, without sending a POST request from Janeway. This would not be as good a user experience because the user can't enter anything on Janeway, only on the secondary MailChimp form.

**Describe the bug**

As long as Google Pay is provided in the Checkout, a connection to fonts.googleapis.com is made

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. In the consent manager of your choice (we use consentmanager.net) don't allow google fonts
2. Go to checkout (Onestep checkout)
3. Check the network tab
4. Google fonts are loaded

**Expected behavior**

Google fonts are only loaded if the user gives consent.

**Magento version**
2.4.5

**Plugin version**
8.10.0

**Screenshots**

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux, Windows
 - Browser Chrome
 - Version 117

**Additional context**

In Germany there are was a wave of cease and desist letters to not use Google Fonts, so this is a quite important topic.

I guess it would be okay to load google fonts as soon as Google Pay is selected, but it is loading initially on opening the checkout.

Can this be optimized?",GDPR,GDPR,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

We will drop current `db-tools:anonymization:run`/`db-tools:anonymize` command.

Current `db-tools:gdprify` will become `db-tools:anonymization:run`/`db-tools:anonymize`.

This command will be use like this:

```sh
db-tools:anonymize /path/to/my/backup
```
1. backup current database
2. import given backup file
3. anonymize database
4. export database overwriting the given backup file
5. restore initial database backup

The documentation will describe a *fully* GDPR-compatible workflow :

1. On your prod env launch : `db-tools:backup`
2. Download this backup file on a secured environment (like a preprod)
3. launch `db-tools:anonymize /path/to/my/backup` on this secured environment
4. download and restore the anonymized backup on your local machine

The `db-tools:anonymize` command will also start by warn user that he should not run this command on an ensecured env.

The command could be run with a `--current-database` then it will behavior like the old version of `db-tools:anonymize`.

The command will be interactive by default (ask if, you want to backup/restore the current database)but should be launch with `-n` if you want to run it the classic way (with a backup and a restore of the current state)",GDPR,GDPR,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

for example, it requires a separate deployment to production, avoid
using the ""fixes"" keyword and instead attach the [Status] Fix Inbound label to
the linked issue.

Related to #

## Proposed Changes

* This passes in the cart contents as a string (instead of passing in the transaction/order ID) as the conversion label in Parsely. Parsely does not support more complex objects, but this will give us an indication of which products are converting vs. which blog posts.

## Testing Instructions

<!--
Add as many details as possible to help others reproduce the issue and test the fix.
""Before / After"" screenshots can also be very helpful when the change is visual.
-->

* If in GDPR, allow ""analytics"" tracking. If you're testing locally, either temporarily change `development.json` to allow `ad-tracking` and `cookie-banner`, or pass these in as `?flags=ad-tracking,cookie-banner` in the URL on the checkout page.
* Make sure that you see calls to parsely.com in the network tab. They should look similar to this:
    * `https://cdn.parsely.com/keys/wordpress.com/p.js?ver=3.3.2` for loading the base tracking code
    * `http://p1.parsely.com/plogger/?rand=1704198873194....` for sending off the tracking call, where the key prop is `data` containing the cart items, e.g. `{""_conversion_type"":""purchase"",""_conversion_label"":""personal-bundle, dotblog_domain""}` 
    * You will also see one more `/plogger` call that fires off a pageview event.
* If tracking is disallowed (the user has not consented, or explicitly opted out of analytics, no tracking calls should be made.

When clicking on a map feature layer, no pop-up opens.  This issue is occurring in Microsoft Legacy Edge (Microsoft Edge 44.x) with Leaflet.js 1.7.1.  





It does not happen in the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer 11.  It also does not happen with Leaflet.js 1.6.0.  It may be a Leaflet.js issue, I'm not sure.





And I recognize the issue is with Legacy Edge, by my organization (local government) still has our users using this version of Edge.   





## Expected behavior





A pop-up should open when clicking on the map feature.





## To Reproduce





1. Go to https://gis.ccpa.net/labs/edge-leaflet-issues/


2. Click on the orange circle icons





## Environment Information





- Version of Leaflet (`L.version`): 1.7.1


- Version of Esri Leaflet (`L.esri.VERSION`): 2.5.0


- Your OS: Microsoft Windows 10


- Browser and Version: Microsoft Edge 44.18362.449.0",CCPA,CCPA,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

This shows how to do a UMAP plot of the low dimension embedding generated by CCPA.





@MxMstrmn Just have a brief look at the list of files and then merge it. The notebook should have everything you need to make nice UMAP plots, I could already see quite some clustering happening in the `seq2seq` embedding.





I also did a bit of cleanup:


- Removed everything in `notebooks/`, since we've used non if it


- Removed all notebooks in `preprocessing` that are for different datasets


- Cleaned up the `simon/` folder by deleting old yaml configs and moving important plotting scripts to my repo (`mt_thesis`)


- Add `.py` version of all remaining notebooks",CCPA,CCPA,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

When executing the workflow for an experiment that requires pulling verification observation files from the NOAA HPSS, it should execute successfully.

## Current behavior
The exregional_get_obs scripts have not been updated in over a year. In that time, the tar file names on the NOAA HPSS have been updated; however, those changes have not been reflected in the exregional_get_obs scripts. Therefore, more recent dates fail when you try and pull them from the NOAA HPSS.

## Machines affected
Tasks for pulling recent observation files needed for verification will fail on any platform that is trying to access the NOAA HPSS.

## Steps To Reproduce
Setup an experiment to run a 6-h forecast including pulling the observation files from the NOAA HPSS. I ran 20230515 00 UTC, and it failed. 

## Detailed Description of Fix (optional)
Modify exregional_get_obs_ccpa.sh, exregional_get_obs_mrms.sh, and exregional_get_obs_ndas.sh to update date ranges of file names on the NOAA HPSS. A longer term fix would to include verification obs similar to exregional_get_da_obs.sh.",CCPA,CCPA,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

During https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/21318 for 4.8.0-alpha2 it was detected that the new `Vulnerability Detection` Dashboard does not show alerts for Windows Agents. The cluster has a Linux and a Windows Agent but vulnerabilities are only shown for the Manager and Linux Agent.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to Vulnerability Detection
2. See error that no Alerts are shown.
3. Filter by agent and the agent's section is empty
4. Check alerts on manager and Alerts for agent have been generated

**Expected behavior**
Windows Agent Vulnerability Detector alerts are shown.

**Describe the bug**

Argo is scaling down, and then back up the jobservice, repository and core deployments for Harbor service:
![image](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/assets/518320/05058e5b-8c95-411f-89b4-c64a22ca161d)
![image](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/assets/518320/1d6968d0-46df-4c44-bff1-efcfceffa79d)

From what I can tell, nothing is changing in harbor, especially with these 3 services, to cause them to be scaled down/backup.


**To Reproduce**

install harbor using the following app/apps:

We develop our projects in `docker` containers and one thing we do is (re)install all requirements when the container is (re)started. I noticed that in some cases `pip` was faster than `uv`, so I did some testing.

I created a test `requirements.txt` file:
```requirements.txt
Django~=4.2.0
django-email-bandit~=2.0.0
djangorestframework~=3.14.0
django-filter~=23.2
leukeleu-django-checks~=1.2
leukeleu-django-gdpr~=1.4
psycopg2-binary~=2.9.6
sentry-sdk~=1.18
wagtail~=5.1.0
coverage[toml]~=7.2
pywatchman~=2.0.0
ruff~=0.3.2
```

A minimal `pip.sh`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
python -m venv ./venv/pip
source ./venv/pip/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and a minimal `uv.sh`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
uv venv ./venv/uv
source ./venv/uv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I then started a `python` container using 

```
docker run --rm -itv `pwd`:/code -w /code python bash
```

This container runs Python 3.12.3 with pip 24.0.

I used `pip` to install `uv` at version 0.1.31

I then timed both scripts multiple times, to get the times for a cold (no venv/cache) and warm (existing venv/cach) install:

```shell
# time ./pip.sh
...
real	0m25.336s
user	0m9.570s
sys	0m2.723s

# time ./pip.sh
...
real	0m2.013s
user	0m1.614s
sys	0m0.153s

# time ./uv.sh 
...
real	0m5.579s
user	0m2.018s
sys	0m2.426s

# time ./uv.sh
...
real	0m7.100s
user	0m0.233s
sys	0m1.833s
```

As expected, on a cold install `uv` outperforms `pip` by a wide margin. However, unexpectedly, the second install is slower (it's even slower than `uv` first run).

I suspected that the mounted volume had something to do with this. So I copied the scripts and requirements file to another directory in the container (one that is not mounted) and timed everything again (note that I did *not* remove the pip and uv download caches):

```shell
# time ./pip.sh
...
real	0m7.413s
user	0m6.079s
sys	0m0.491s

# time ./pip.sh
...
real	0m1.627s
user	0m1.543s
sys	0m0.085s

# time ./uv.sh 
...
real	0m0.174s
user	0m0.073s
sys	0m0.270s

# time ./uv.sh
...
real	0m0.232s
user	0m0.061s
sys	0m0.319s
```

This time `uv` beats `pip` easily (however the second invocation is still somewhat slower than the initial one).

- [X] I have searched for similar issues in open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.
- [ ] I have troubleshooted my issue, and it still exists against the latest stable version of Elementor.

### Description

I am currently trying to dynamically add CC email addresses to an Elementor form's email through the WordPress functions.php file. My client wants me to only add the CC email addresses when a specific value from a drop down / select field is selected. I've managed to get it to work but now it adds those CC email addresses to both emails.

I use the Elementor Form Actions After Submit Emails in the following ways: 

1. Email = supplied information is send to the website owner
2. Email 2 = a copy of the supplied informi s send to the visitor who filled out the form

Here is the code:

    ##############################################################################
    // Action is called when the forms is submitted and being processed
    ##############################################################################
    add_action( 'elementor_pro/forms/process', 'add_cc_emails_to_submitted_elementor_forms', 10, 2 );
    function add_cc_emails_to_submitted_elementor_forms( $record, $handler ) {
    	// Get the form name
    	$form_name = $record->get_form_settings( 'form_name' );
    	
    	// Check which form is being processed
        if ( $form_name !== 'FORM NAME') {
            return;
        }
    
    	// Create an array of all the fields used in the form
    	$raw_fields = $record->get( 'fields' );
    	
    	// Get the selected branch
    	$drop_down_field_value = $raw_fields['field_name']['value'];
    	
    	// Set the CC email addresses
    	if( $drop_down_field_value === 'SOMETHING' ){	
    		// Call the filter to apply the needed CC Emails
    		add_filter( 'elementor_pro/forms/wp_mail_headers', 'add_cc_emails_to_elementor_form', 10, 1 );
    	}
    }
    
    ##############################################################################
    // Add CC email addresses to the Email Header
    ##############################################################################
    function add_cc_emails_to_elementor_form( $headers ) {
    	
    	// Set all the CC email addresses	
    	$headers .= ""Cc: something@email.com\r\n"";
    	$headers .= ""Cc: something2@email.com\r\n"";
        
    	return $headers;
    }

Is there a way for me to set the headers based on the email that is being send. I only need the CC email addresses added to Email 1 (the one that gets send to the website owner) and not Email 2. The information on the developer docs (https://developers.elementor.com/docs/hooks/forms/) don't mention anything about it.

### Steps to reproduce

1. You can re-create the issue by creating a form with a select / drop down field, email & email 2 actions
2. Copying the supplied code into your functions.php file
3. Update the **FORM NAME** and **SOMETHING** if statements to values supplied in the created form ( **add_cc_emails_to_submitted_elementor_forms** function )
4. Update the email addresses inside of the **add_cc_emails_to_elementor_form** function to email addresses that you use.
5. Save the changes.
6. Open the form in your browser and submit it. This should now send the emails like normal with the CC email addresses added to the header.

### Expected behavior

I would like to be able to easily check which Elementor form email is being send and then apply the needed headers to it through PHP and the available hooks. Maybe some sort of **email_type** check which I can grab from the **Form_Record**.

Example:
```
// Get the email type
$email_type = $record->get_form_settings( 'email_type' );

// Check if the email type is Email 1
if ( 'email' === $email_type ) {
// Some code here.
}
```

### Isolating the problem

- [ ] This bug happens when only the Elementor (and Elementor Pro) plugins are active.
- [X] This bug happens with the Hello Elementor theme active.
- [X] I can reproduce this bug consistently by following the steps I described above.

## User Story


<!-- Required. -->


As a site admin, I want my donors to be able to process donations in countries that don't require a state, and as a result, that field is hidden on page load.





In my Give settings, I've set my default country to Germany. This removes the state field from displaying on the donation form by default.


<!-- Expand on the user story if necessary. -->





## Current Behavior


<!-- Required. Include any warnings or errors in the browser or console. -->


When my donor clicks submit, the processing circle quickly displays and they aren't redirected to PayPal.





If I remove the requirement from the State field with a custom code snippet the donation processes without issue.





Snippet here:


```


function give_dont_require_fields( $required_fields, $form_id ) {


	if(isset($required_fields['card_state'])) {


		unset($required_fields['card_state']);


	}


	return $required_fields;


}


add_filter( 'give_donation_form_required_fields', 'give_dont_require_fields', 10, 2 );





```


## Expected Behavior


<!-- Required. -->


I expect my donors to be able to process donations without having to add a custom code snippet.





## Bug Type


<!-- Required. Include version number if functionality worked as expected in previous version. -->


- [x] This bug describes functionality that once worked as expected in version X.X.X.








## Steps to Reproduce


<!-- Required. -->


1. Set the default Country in Give to be Germany


2. Configure the PayPal gateway to require billing details 


3. Without using auto-populate, fill out the billing details fields.


4. Process the donation and see that it doesn't go through


5. View the console and see the error





## Visuals


<!-- Optional. Include screenshots, mockups, or video to clarify the bug. Delete if not applicable. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Donors can process donations when the default country is set to Germany.

https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/7373,486076577.00000000000,2,#NULL!,0,N/A,N/A,vault operator step-down timeout problems,"Hi,





When we issue `vault operator step-down`, Vault seems to revoke leases one-by-one sequentially (at least per auth mount). We share one vault for 15+ k8s clusters (mounted on 15+ paths)  that can be down at any moment. When we do ` vault operator step-down` when multiple k8s clusters are simply not running to save AWS cost,  vault step-down really tries to revoke leases _one-by-one_ like below in the logs, failing cause of timeout adding up for every revoke. During this step-down process, Vault from a load-balancer client  is simply down (timeouts waiting for headers) for half an hour until all revokes failed, even though we have 3 instances behind an AWS load-balancer. 





Would it be possible to revoke leases upon step-down per mount-path concurrently, instead of subsequently?

After activating Simple Lightbox I navigate to the settings and get a message:


Activation


There has been a critical error on your website. Please check your site admin email inbox for instructions.





Activating debug on wordpress I get the following details (I replaced the path to the WP installation on my server by _WP_ROOT_):





Fatal error:


Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function xml_parser_create() in _WP_ROOT_/wp-content/plugins/simple-lightbox/includes/class.field_type.php:293

#5 _WP_ROOT_/wp-content/plugins/simple-lightbox/include in _WP_ROOT_/wp-content/plugins/simple-lightbox/includes/class.field_type.php on line 293





Not sure whether this is relevant, but I had Simple Lightbox activated a long time ago (not sure when/which version, sorry), then I did not use it (deactivated) for a long time, so I thought some obsolete stuff could have persisted in the database and causing the problem.


So I also tried to completely remove Simple Lightbox, then I re-installed it. But the error persists.

During the Backward step, using Snowballing `v1.0.0`, in cell `BackwardSnowballing(""ujcich2018a"", articles=article_list)`, some articles did not show the insert command.


Running the insert commands which were drawn for me, I've got this [database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPAhqKB1eY2dm8OmFh5AOQ1XLQ_MJvZL/view?usp=sharing) folder; thus, I did repeat the Backward by only considering in the `article_list` the articles which were not drawn in the first run.





These are the bibtex of the articles that I use in the second run:

- [x] color theme and outsource some stuff to CSS


- [x] improve create card


- [x] highlight creator name on card


- [x] show time of event on card


- [x] sort cards by date/time of event. Show unscheduled cards sorted by creation date after all scheduled cards

- [x] caldav/iCal feed? Implemented at https://github.com/HULKs/mopad/tree/ical


  - Implemented via Firebase Functions which requires the Blaze billing plan to deploy the function (not available in the free plan)


  - Some minor tweaks are still left to do (e.g. add a `duration` field to talks, fill the `location` with a sensible value)

- [x] **talk scheduling is broken (see error in console)**


- [x] **edit dialog updates when other users update talks (resets changes)**


- [x] **test with different time zones** @PasGl 


- [x] allow to add hashtags and maybe allow to filter by hashtag @schmidma 


- [x] Set `homepage` in `package.json`


- [x] let user and scheduler edit talk duration


- [x] allow collapsing past talks or add ability to quickly scroll over them


- [x] login and register forms should allow to select a team with the keyboard


- [x] improve error messages (login, register, talk editing, talk scheduling, talk creation, etc.)


- [x] long description lines that cannot wrap (e.g. single word) break layout of cards


- [x] hide delete button for normal users (only users with ""editor"" role should be allowed to delete talks)


- [x] disallow empty title and/or description


- [x] add counter of nerds and noobs to the labels


- [x] disable `user-select: none` and rethink how to get tooltips to work on mobile (long press selects random text on page instead of displaying the tooltip)


- [x] allow pressing enter to submit various forms throughout the application (e.g. login, register, talk dialogs, etc.)


- [x] FAB is not on top of buttons on cards (check that dialog backdrops are still on top of the FAB, see https://material-ui.com/customization/z-index/#z-index)

- [ ] ~~Login with Discord~~ maybe too complicated for the RoHOW

Forum is working but server load is higher and incoming connections through firewall has increased significantly





--





I initially thought my timing was unlucky and the server was experiencing an attack. However after reverting the SocketIO related code, which I thought was the most likely culprit, the forum is running back as it was again. 





I reverted 13d5a1440b813013ba48644c9f280bf13a9c41bf, 62463430a9b08954c3791fdf7479c8b5ddb2ab6f, and 1c45fa1ba52ee237ade60d8d020c39fd77a944ab

+ Install and activate the Yoast SEO plugin


+ Open the course builder, add a quiz to a lesson


+ Save the changes (or wait for the auto-save if you're not a control-freak :P)





### Expected Behavior





+ I'd expect the changes (quiz addition) to be saved with no errors





### Actual Behavior





+ The quiz is created but only ""partially"" saved - meaning that not all of its properties have been saved. Plus an error is shown in the builder:

It seems that when saving (I think on post insertion?!) Yoast SEO ""expands"" the post content (meaning that applies `'the_content'` filter), in this case the quiz content, when the quiz's lesson meta has not been set yet.


But in our template we just assume that this is always set.

### Details





Databunker (https://databunker.org/) is an open-source, network-based, self-hosted, GDPR compliant, secure storage for personal data.





I would like to add this tool under ```Useful links, tools, and advice``` -> ```Resources```.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/31086,869527804.00000000000,7,#NULL!,0,N/A,N/A,Missing onError handler for invocation 'building-schema': Names must match /^[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*$/,"## Description





Dynamic page queries are resulting in current version to new ""typeBuilder""-type in gatsby/dist/schema/schema.js, and later on fail through assertValidName() in checkIsAllowedTypeName() because of its name. In the previous version, this type did not exist and therefore did not fail. I guess this type its not needed or at least the created type name is wrong.





### Steps to reproduce





File with name ""{StrapiBlogPost.slug}.js"" is existing with this query:





```


export const query = graphql`


  query BlogPostQuery($slug: String!) {

```





the error raises because of a new type which is checked in [this](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/schema/schema.js#L313) line that its name is valid. a console.log in the previous version right before this line did show that the type for the query was not existing.

I have installed Gravitee on a AWS VM





I have created my first API using gravitee relying on an endpoint and it works just fine (/jfmcustomers)








Now if I import a swagger (OASV3) it does not work.





If I call `myIpadfress//services/hubcustomerjfm/Customer?id=84` it says `404 No context-path matches the request URI.`

## Prerequisites


<!-- MARK COMPLETED ITEMS WITH AN [x] -->

This happens to all websites using Elementor and Elementor Pro, reverting back to a previous Version made no difference.





## Steps to reproduce

    -   [ ] Provide details for any automatically detected npm dependencies


    -   [ ] Manually add any repository dependencies (if you can't add manually, refer [here](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/cg/features/cgmanifest/)). Only add a cgmanifest.json if the components are not NPM or are not dev only.


-   [ ] Create new release branch with format `release-YYYY.MM.100`


    -   [ ] Mark release branch as not deletable (add it explicitly here, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/settings/branches)


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `release-YYYY.MM` for changes


    -   [x] Run `npm install` to make sure [`package-lock.json`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/package.json) is up-to-date


    -   [x] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


        -   [x] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/tree/main/news) (typically `python news --final --update CHANGELOG.md | code-insiders -`)


        -   [x] Copy over the ""Thanks"" section from the previous release into the ""Thanks"" section for the new release


        -   [x] Make sure the ""Thanks"" section is up-to-date (e.g. compare to versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/requirements.txt))


        -   [x] Touch up news entries (e.g. add missing periods)


        -   [x] Check the Markdown rendering to make sure everything looks good


    -   [ ] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) as appropriate. This file is manually edited so you can check with the teams if anything needs to be added here.


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `release-YYYY.MM`


-   [ ] Update the [`release` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/branches)


    -   [ ] If there are `release` branches that are two versions old (e.g. release-2020.[current month - 2]) you can delete them at this time


-   [ ] Update `main` after creating the release branch. (Warning: this should happen right after creating the release branch. If this is deferred till later, the `main` and `release` branches can diverge significantly, which may cause merge conflicts.)


    -   [x] Merge the changes from release (Changelog, delete news, ThirdPartyNotices) into `main` branch


    -   [ ] Turn off automatic uploads for pre-release builds from main by pausing/disabling the pre-release pipeline (go into [pre-release pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_build?definitionId=283&_a=summary) and select `Settings` from the `More Options` menu (`:`) and pause/disable the pipeline). This prevents stable customers from getting pre-release builds.


    -   [x] Ensure that the engine version and extension version in the `main` branch are **not changed**.


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `main`


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `main`


-   [ ] GDPR bookkeeping (@greazer) (ðŸ¤–; Notes in OneNote under Python VS Code -> Dev Process -> GDPR)


-   [ ] Open appropriate [documentation issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apython)


    -   new features


    -   settings changes


    -   etc. (ask the team)


-   [ ] Schedule a sanity test. Aim for close after freeze so there is still time to fix release bugs before release. Ask teams before bash for specific areas that need testing.


-   [x] Is the validation pipeline clear? If not, drive to make sure that it is clear for release. Sanity test can be used to help with this.


-   [ ] Ask CTI to test the release candidate





# Testing (Monday of VS Code release week, Mar 03)





-  [x] Obtain VS Code [prebuild](https://builds.code.visualstudio.com/builds/stable) for sanity testing


-  [x] Sanity test release candidate VSIX against VS Code prebuild


-  [ ] Candidate bug fixes found from sanity test should be checked into `main` and cherry-picked to `release` branch


-  [ ] Manually publish Monday's VS Code Insiders release from `main` branch to minimize gap in Insiders program





# Release (Tuesday or day before VS Code publishes, whichever is later)





## Preparation





-   [ ] Make sure the [appropriate pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls) for the release notes(https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/v<vscode version>.md, make note of the branch and file name).


    - [ ] Include all new new features under a section named `Jupyter` with screenshots or animated gifs.


    - [ ] Fixes, code health should remain in the Jupyter change log.


-   [x] Make sure component governance is happy


-   [x] Make sure there is nothing targeting this release that still needs to be validated


        (`is:issue sort:updated-desc milestone:""<milestone>"" label:verification-needed -label:verified`)





## Release





-   [ ] Publish the release


    -   [ ] Use the generated VSIX (from last build for the release branch) and sanity test the VSIX against VS Code prebuild


    -   [ ] For an automated release


        -   [ ] Create a commit which contains the words `publish` and `release` in it (you can use --allow-empty if needed)


        -   [ ] Directly push (PR not required) the commit to the `release-xxxx.xx` branch


        -   [ ] This commit will trigger the `release` stage to run after smoke tests. [Example run](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/actions/runs/702919634)


        -   [ ] For release branches a mail will be sent to verify that the release should be published. Click the `Review pending deployments` button on the mail and deploy from the GitHub page. This will publish the release on the marketplace.


    -   [ ] For manual (if needed as automatic should be tried first)


        -   [ ] Download the [Release VSIX](https://pvsc.blob.core.windows.net/extension-builds-jupyter/ms-toolsai-jupyter-release.vsix) & Make sure no extraneous files are being included in the `.vsix` file (make sure to check for hidden files)


        -   [ ] Go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/ms-toolsai?noPrompt=true and upload the VSIX


            -   [ ] If there's errors, try diffing against old vsix that worked


        -   [ ] Go to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases and add a new release


            -   [ ] Tag is version number


            -   [ ] Branch is release branch


            -   [ ] Copy contents of release branch changelog into the release (just copy the markdown)


            -   [ ] Save


-   [ ] Determine if a hotfix is needed


    -   [ ] Ensure the version in package.json is updated as follows:


        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.100`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.110`


        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.110`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.120`





# Day of VS Code publishing (Wednesday, XXX XX)


-   [ ] Update `main` after the release is published.


    -   [ ] Bump the engines.vscode version on the `main` branch. For example, from `1.58.0` to `1.59.0`


    -   [ ] Bump the version number to the next monthly (""YYYY.M.100"") release in the `main` branch


        -   [ ] `package.json`


        -   [ ] `package-lock.json`


        -   [ ] Confirm the 3rd part of the version ends with `100`.


    -   [ ] Turn pre-release daily builds back on (enable the [pre-release pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_build?definitionId=283&_a=summary) 


-   [ ] Go through [`info needed` issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3Ainfo-needed) and close any that have no activity for over a month (ðŸ¤–)


-   [ ] GDPR bookkeeping (ðŸ¤–) ((@greazer does regular classification every Monday evening))


-   [ ] If any steps were unclear or changed in this release plan please update the `release_plan.md` file to make it clear for the next release





## Prep for the _next_ release





-   [ ] Create a new [release plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/main/.github/release_plan.md) (ðŸ¤–)


    * Title `<Month> <year> Release Plan`


    * Add the labels `endgame-plan` to this issue

Those are new apps for experiments





**Repro**





I have two apps registered within Azure AD that support both multitenant and personal accounts (**external** and **internal**)


For external, the API Permission is set for the internal app so it can downstream the user information within the token.





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25317691/159719705-7c61c93d-edb2-4c1c-83ac-2073d50e28b8.png)





I'm using Postman for testing calling internal from external on behave of the identified user.


I'm retrieving access tokens using the Authorization tab





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25317691/159723081-9bad7b86-ca81-42d8-b9c1-05c5f1550b53.png)





where for the scope I provide the one registered for external, as using '.default' returns invalid_scope from Postman.


When I try to call


```csharp


string accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(_scopesToAccessDownstreamApi);


```


with either '.default' scope or one registered for internal in `_scopesToAccessDownstreamApi` I receive the exception (I'm using the Application ID URI of internal for those scopes)





**Expected behavior**


Code should work despite supported account types for which the app is registered.





**Actual behavior**

<!-- Please do not include any customer data or Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in any content posted to GitHub. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr#gdpr-faqs for more info on PII.-->


The same code works when I use single-tenant registered apps. The only difference is in ""TennantId"" at appsettings.json where for this case it is set to 'common', also the URLs for authorize and token at Postman have TennantId instead of common.





The same issue is for apps registered to support only personal accounts so I'm assuming there is some issue related to provisioning the access to downstream API for tokens generated for personal accounts. 


Additionally, for those apps, I'm not able to change the status to granted, even though I'm logged in as Global Administrator.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,N/A,N/A,N/A,0

I somehow managed to bust my installation and am getting lots of flow-related errors, so I thought it would be good to just start fresh and rebuild my flows to get rid of the accumulated cruft in my policies. However, it appears the `initial-setup` flow does not work:


```

1. Set up new authentik container


2. Try to fill out the `initial-setup` prompt stage


3. Get the above error in the logs and ""Unknown error"" in the flow

https://github.com/mollie/WooCommerce/issues/703,1349560786.00000000000,1,#NULL!,0,N/A,N/A,"Incorrect order ""Completed"" status after payment","> WP Version: 6.0.1


> WC Version: 6.7.0


> Mollie Payments for WooCommerce: by Mollie â€“ 7.3.0





After a client completes the order through Mollie, the order status gets updates correctly to ""Pending"", but a couple of minutes later it gets updates to ""Shipped"" and therefor is set to completed by Woocommerce.





However the order is **not** shipped yet and most certainly not complete. Completion is handled by an external CRM, however since the order is already set to Complete it never reaches the CRM (which pulls orders after payment, but before completion).





![mollie-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1245173/186444150-1662fb1b-55df-40c1-a95b-3426f5786fd8.jpg)





The issue seems to be caused by the `shipAndCaptureOrderAtMollie` method, which should never be called.


https://github.com/mollie/WooCommerce/blob/0ec01f2001f8fd80aae1e960c53155ffda96e915/src/Payment/PaymentModule.php#L374-L378





Adding `add_option('mollie-payments-for-woocommerce_disableShipOrderAtMollie', '1');` doesn't seem to prevent this from happening. And since the message clearly states that Mollie changes the status of the order to ""Shipped"" it seems very unlikely that another plugin causes the issue.


During our testing (before June 1st) with live payments we didn't see this issue and all orders were handled correctly. After that we see all orders being completed automatically due to Mollie updating the orders to shipped.





All products are physical products (simple or variable, non are downloads or virtual). And the issue occurs to all payments through Mollie, independent of the provider used.








Is this a bug, or is a(nother) setting which we're missing?

### Provide a description that is worded well enough to be understood

Apologies. Apparently I'm cursed to periodically find issues with Crunchyroll downloads.





Here's my (perhaps a little overzealously) redacted cookies.txt. You'll notice that the string yt-dlp breaks on is contained in some of those Optanon cookies. Deleting them from the file and retrying the download works, so I'm guessing it's *just* that. Still, a proper fix would be much appreciated.

- [X] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.


- [X] The issue still exists against the latest stable version of Elementor.





### Description





Hello !


I am trying to change product title heading in product related loop. I need to change it from h2 to h4. I added some code to function.php which is working. but building the page with elementor widget, the code is not working anymore. Seems that elementor is bypassing the woocommerce hoocks. here is the code :





````php


function action_woocommerce_shop_loop_item_title()


{


global $woocommerce_loop;


// Only for related products


if (isset($woocommerce_loop['name']) && $woocommerce_loop['name'] === 'related') {


// Removes a function from a specified action hook.


remove_action('woocommerce_shop_loop_item_title', 'woocommerce_template_loop_product_title', 10);


echo '<h4 class=""' . esc_attr(apply_filters('woocommerce_product_loop_title_classes', 'woocommerce-loop-product__title')) . '"">' . get_the_title() . '</h4>';


}


}


add_action('woocommerce_shop_loop_item_title', 'action_woocommerce_shop_loop_item_title', 9);


````





anybody has any idea with this code is not working with elementor related product widget ?! thx !








### Steps to reproduce





1. using elementor template for product single


2. add widget related product


3. add code in function.php


4. and this is not working :) 





### Isolating the problem





- [X] This bug happens with only Elementor plugin active (and Elementor Pro).


- [ ] This bug happens with a Blank WordPress theme active ([Hello theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/)).


- [X] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.

### Description

Hi,
Somebody else wrote about it in this thread https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce/issues/393
And we are experiencing the same issue. If you read the discussion, they suggest at the end that the cause of this might lie in gatsby-source-wordpress.
The given solution, which is manually cleaning the cache, is not convenient when you manage hundred of websites as you might understand.
I wanted to ask if there is any update regarding this or plan to fix it. 
The error occurs only for products (WooCommerce plugin in Wordpress) and it seems to be cause by a gatsby-source-wordpress depency if I am reading the error log correctly, called _graphql-compose_. The action_monitor on anything else (post, page, cpt) seems to work fine otherwise.

I tried to install a minimal reproduction on the sandbox but it says I need node 18 (and have 16) and did not manage to change the version via nvm after installing it? So I cannot provide a reproduction link unfortunately. Hope you can reproduce by following the steps

### Reproduction Link

https://github.com/MichLan90/bug-repro-gsw

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone repo and install node modules with `npm i`
2. Launch the repo with `npm run develop/gatsby develop`
3. Login into our test CMS (Wordpress). I created a user for you to test this:
https://test.enkle.re/wp-admin
Username: bug_repro
Password: bug_repro_2023!
4. Once everything is set up, its enough to update a product on wordpress to reproduce the error

### Description





Just some minor things noticed when clicking around the footer looking for pages.





* Cleans up ""Meet the Specialists"" page


* Rebuilds the CCPA data request form

With #2505 we are introducing a page where Salim will be able to download his generated data exports from, instead of the emails. This change will help us: 


- be GDPR compliant; 


- stimulate more responsible data handling as data is not so easily shareable (not already in your email); 


- enable Salim to re-download the data export if he just wants the same file again 


- support a cleaner UI where information (status updates) are shared with Salim directly in the page he is in, without having to navigate to different parts of Flow or his email 





# Opportunity 





With these changes we also want to improve how we communicate to Salim that Flow cannot generate the data file, for one reason or the other. Currently we only say when file generation fails immediately using a pop up message right after Salim hits the Generate button. We do not tell Salim that the generation has stopped because of something ""wrong"" with the form structure, for example. 





# When can export generation fail and how quickly does Flow know





Generating a data file can fail for multiple reasons: 


- Flow services is down - we know right away 


- A question in the form does not have the question text - after a while: https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/issues/2433


- A bug in the report engine (that we did not find in testing) causes a crash.  


- if the Caddisfly test type was not selected (i think) 


- other.. 





# ~General failure~





~If Flow services is down for some reason, or generating the file fails right away we should show the message directly in the UI, where Salim is. This shows right away after hitting Generate.~

## Failure to generate for specific form 





If generating the file fails after a few seconds for a specific form related reason, we bring Salim to the Generated exports page and then show a form specific error message. This should hold the form name and reason for failure for Salim knows what he needs to change or adjust to make the export work.

relationship between Art. 15(1) and (3) GDPR. Basically, those are the


two differing opinions:





1. The ""The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data


   undergoing processing."" from Art. 15(3) GDPR mandates how, in


   particular, to give the data subject ""access to the personal data""


   according to Art. 15(1) GDPR.





   As such, a request according to Art. 15(1) GDPR includes a request


   for a copy.


2. Art. 15(1) and (3) GDPR are separate rights. A data subject that


   wants a copy of their data explicitly has to request that according


   to Art. 15(3) GDPR.





We believe that by requesting ""all personal data concerning me that


you have stored"", as we did until now in our access template, it is


obvious that we are in fact requesting a copy of said data.


From countless access requests using our template that we have


submitted ourselves or have been told about by our users, we have also


not seen a single case where a controller interpreted our wording


differently.





However, a user recently kindly forwarded us a response from a data


protection authority to a complaint that did not provide a copy after


they requested access using our template. The authority ruled that it


was not clear from the request that the user in fact asked for a copy


and as such the controller acted correctly.





While we don't agree with the authority's assessment, one of our


primary goals with our request templates is to provide legal certainty


to our users.


As such, we have decided to change the access templates to explicitly


ask for a copy according to Art. 15(3) GDPR. This ensures that there


can be no more misunderstandings in the future and that our users have


a strong legal case for defending against controllers that don't


provide them with a copy of their data.





For reference, this is some of the literature on this topic (only in


German, unfortunately):

Add an option such as `--file my_urls.txt`, where `my_urls.txt` would be some text file with one URL/post ID per line. It would attempt to download each URL/ID, behaving just like the other modes such as `--subreddit`.

The backend system must support a comprehensive set of functionalities to manage user accounts effectively. Here's a detailed list of the required functionalities:
### User Registration
- [x] #141
- **Endpoint for Account Creation**: A secure API endpoint to register new users. It should collect essential information like username, email, and password. 
- [x] #140

- **Email Verification**: After registration, send a verification email to the user to validate their email address, enhancing account security.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure all user input is validated for format and uniqueness (e.g., email and username) to prevent invalid data entry.

## 2. Login
- **Authentication Endpoint**: A secure login API that authenticates users based on their credentials (username/email and password).
- **Session Management**: Create and manage user sessions, providing a token (e.g., JWT) for accessing authorized endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting on Login Attempts**: To prevent brute force attacks, implement rate limiting on login attempts from the same IP address.

## 3. Profile Editing
- **Profile Update Endpoint**: Allow users to update their profile information, including personal details like name, contact information, and profile pictures.
- **Password Change Functionality**: Securely enable users to change their passwords, including current password verification and strong password enforcement.
- **Data Validation**: Validate changes to ensure that email addresses, if editable, remain unique and personal information adheres to format requirements.

## 4. Account Deletion
- **Deletion Endpoint**: Provide a secure method for users to delete their accounts, requiring re-authentication or password confirmation to prevent unauthorized deletions.
- **Data Handling**: Define how the user's data is handled post-deletion, ensuring compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR). This may involve permanently removing user data or anonymizing it for record-keeping.

## Security and Compliance
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data, especially passwords, must be encrypted using robust algorithms (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing).
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all API endpoints use HTTPS to secure data in transit.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data protection and privacy regulations to protect user information and rights.

Implementing these backend functionalities provides a solid foundation for user account management, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.

The User class represents a registered user in the system. Users should be able to perform the following actions:",CCPA,CCPA,right to erasure,right to erasure,right to erasure,7

Refactor the GDPR service dry-run to not return a list of applications. Instead, return true if the information can be deleted and throw an exception if it can't. This also means that the delete call needs to be refactored to not receive a list of applications, but fetch them from the DB again.

Besides supporting both the old and Kortisto model of GDPR service, this also has the added benefit of loading the information to be deleted in the same transaction as they are deleted in, so there's no chance of the information changing between the loading and deleting.

Implement the canDelete method for `KortistoGdprService`. This checks that the user is not on any active applications, and is not the only admin user (user with KAIKKI_OIKEUDET privileges) in the hanke. If the user shouldn't be deleted, all the conflicting applications are gathered and thrown in an exception. The controller returns the errors in the correct format to Profiili.

https://events.codebasehq.com/projects/event-espresso/tickets/9009

This has come up in the forums and I think there's some room for improvement when it comes to making things easier for event managers.

Steps to reproduce: 
1) Set up an event and assign some people CPTs to the event, save the event.
2) Trash the event
3) Go the trashed events view in the wp admin list table
4) check the box next to the event
5) select the Delete Permanently action and click Apply

Result is you'll see some errors that say you can't delete the event. So now you have to go and restore the event from the trash, then you have to edit the event, and remove all of the relationships to things like People CPts. Then trash, then you can permanently delete.

#1559





However using the dotnet-sdk-2.1.300-rc1 identity scaffolded files, when deleting a user, any saved tokens for the user that are stored in the database table ""AspNetUserTokens"" are left behind so it is not fully deleting the user and their personal data. The User Claims are correctly deleted from ""AspNetUserClaims"" table. Not sure about other related tables as i haven't got around to trying out the roles etc.





This can easily be fixed by modifying the deletion code in the scaffolded files but really needs to be correct from the start.





Another issue is that when downloading personal data, the User Claims are not downloaded from the database, these are relevant as it is personal data that is stored in the database. Obviously if you have a custom user class and have added your own fields then you will need to update the download code to include them, but there is no reason that the claims should not be downloaded by default.





Technically any stored 3rd party provider access tokens should also be included in the download as it is still personal data. I think the hashed password of the local login doesn't count as personal data with it being a hash which is irreversible.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,right to erasure,right to erasure,right to erasure,7

As the new GDPR rules come into play May 25th we need to offer tools to delete all data existing on a customer if requested. It was proposed to do this as an open source package and this PR is intended to provide just those tools.





#### Description





Me and @cneijenhuis worked together to put this together the other day real quick. It is not yet finished but I would love to get your feedback on it so far. Since I am on vacation the rest of this week it would help a lot in order to wrap it up quickly.

As an IT-Administrator I need to delete files according to GDPR. In a lot of cases it is required to make sure that a deleted file cannot be restored, so I need a way to securely erase files in Powershell. 


The cmdlet should be native in powershell, so you don't have to install any additional software





## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)





I think the implementation should be in the original Remove-Item cmdlet. If I add the argument ""-Secure"", I want the file to be overridden.


Override-Content: The most basic function would be to override all bytes the file uses on the harddisk with zeroes. In other cases it may be required to override the bytes with random values.


Repetitions: It may also be required to enter a number of repetions for the override if one override is not sufficient.


Example: Remove-Item C:\Users\Tobias\Secret -Recurse -Secure random -Rep 3


^--> This cmd should securely erase C:\Users\Tobias\Secret with all subfolders and files by overriding all sectors that contain content of the affected files on the volume three times with a random sequence and of course remove the entry in the MFT as before.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,right to erasure,right to erasure,right to erasure,7

  I want to delete all personal data of a user account, including posts and comments


  In order to comply with GDPR


```





If you disabled a user account as admin then this user cannot login anymore. Then this user can also not delete his/her user account anymore. If the user requests deletion of data e.g. by mail then we don't have an UI for that.

**Description of Change:**


Clients were concerned that our documentation stated ""usersâ€™ associated event data will still exist"" even after a delete request from a GDPR compliance point of view. This sentence was misleading since a user's events are actually deleted entirely, it is merely aggregate event counts that remain unaltered. This is already covered in above alert box and explained in a FAQ, hence I'm proposing to remove this sentence to avoid further misunderstandings.

The user manager also obfuscates the user's `UserAddress`es, but `pgcleanup.py` has always just removed those completely (even the non-GDPR version does this).





This tries to avoid changing anything that already exists since the PR is to stable (I'm calling this a bug since the script doesn't do the same thing that Galaxy does), a later dev PR should clean some stuff up:


- The separate handling to zero the `disk_usage` in the original `PurgeDeletedUsers` action seems unnecessary, in the GDPR query I just set it directly to 0 in the `UPDATE`. I assume I did this because I was mindlessly copying the way I did the usage recalculations for active users when purging HDAs?


- Only the first CTE query differs from the non-GDPR version, deduplication would be good (like `PurgesHDA`, but multiple inheritance makes that non-trivial).


- UI user purges are always GDPR-compliant currently, this script allows either, but maybe it should always do GDPR to be consistent with Galaxy. However I can imagine small lab servers not wanting the obfuscation.

  1. Create a user


  2. Mark it deleted


  3. Run `pgcleanup.py -d --older-than 0 purge_deleted_users_gdpr`


  4. Observe that the user's `email` and `username` columns are now SHA1 hashes.


  2. We should probably add some tests for this, especially since it deletes stuff...

At the time being there is no unique identifier of registered timeseries entries. This  may simplify some queries, and help to support some of the ngsi-ld requirements.





From NGSI-LD spec for Properties:


* ""instanceId"": a URI uniquely identifying a Property instance. System generated. Optional.





For temporal representations, systems should maintain an instanceId for each Property instance. Without


such an instanceId, it is not possible to selectively modify or delete temporal information via the


NGSI-LD API. The consequences of this may be severe in the case of modification or deletion requests


for legal reasons, e.g. GDPR [i.18]. When implementing the NGSI-LD API on storage systems that do


NOT allow modification or deletion, similar problems may be encountered.








**Describe the solution you'd like**


1. When a new entity is received, automatically and id is generated from the backend db.

This task appends the version metadata to the file in the package index repository which corresponds to the crate.





We currently have another background worker task, `yank`, which gets called when a version is yanked (or unyanked). This tasks changes the `yanked` value in the version metadata in the package index repository.





Our background worker implementation (https://github.com/sgrif/swirl/) mostly runs tasks in order, but, due to built-in retry logic, that is not guaranteed. This means we could end up in a situation where the tasks are run in an order like: unyank, yank, yank, publish, unyank.





Instead of telling the background worker explicitly what action should be performed, it would be better to only tell it to update the package index repository according to the current state in the database.





We should implement a new `update_index(crate_name, version_num)` background worker task, that looks at the state of the index and of the database and then updates the index according to the current state of the database.





In a second step that background worker tasks should ideally then also handle the cases where versions (or even crates) are completely removed from the database due to e.g. GDPR requests.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,right to erasure,right to erasure,right to erasure,7

# Purpose





Add MASKING_STRICT param. By default this is True, but if False, we can use a GDPR delete request, or a DELETE request if no UPDATE request is configured.





# Changes





-  When `SaaSConnector.mask_data` is called, we instantiate the `query_config` for the given Node and pull the masking request from that node's config, escalating to GDPR Delete or Delete if necessary.  Previously, we would just pull the `update` method by default in `SaaSQueryConfig.generate_update_stmt`


  - Error thrown if primary_key is defined on collection, but no masking request is configured. 


- Allow a `data_protection_request` to be configured on a SaaSConfig - this can potentially be called multiple times, limiting this is out of scope.  To constrain to just one collection, only define a primary_key on one collection for GDPR delete.

## 3 things that might take us down





1. Rate limit API requests. We're emailing people now. @rcmarron 


2. Session recordings taking us down. Let's cap # recordings/day @rcmarron 


3. Same problem, but events @kappa90 





## Retro: Status of Outcomes from Previous Sprint








1. Kick off the persons on events async migration on Cloud and get a self-hosted team to run it @macobo Status: 99% done on self-hosted, cloud-specific clickhouse issue blocking a few million events from being migrated


2. Targeting a 'no rush' 100% - If we identify opportunities to improve the EKS stack we will before switching over @hazzadous - Made a little of progress, events still not on EKS


4. Continue supporting our paying on prem customers (big companies & co) @fuziontech - We have a solid strategy on how to deal with this in future


6. EU Deployment plan (Project docs) @guidoiaquinti - Deprioritised to focus on other stuff


8. S3 Session Recording @rcmarron. Status: Considering a big pivot on this project. Moving to an s3 backed merge table. Looking promising and 50x simpler - still needs more validation. Huge + is that thereâ€™s no new services to maintain/scale. If we donâ€™t go this route, the existing approach is functionally working, but it needs more work for scalability - would leak into the next sprint.


1. Feature flag @neilkakkar Local evaluation of feature flags on server libraries (Python,Go,Ruby,Node,PHP): https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/7115. Status: Decided to focus on getting one library perfect vs speed running. 3 down, 2 to go. 


1. Data Management Finalization + Recordings data management https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/10892 @alexkim205. Status: wrapped data management, recordings still in progress. Stuff pushed to next week


1.  We will have agreed on and tested the tooling and architecture of the design system. @benjackwhite 


  - A lot of tooling work done - new scss utilities work, eslint rules to push us toward the right solution, beginning of work on refined Storybook approach 





## Retro: What can we do better next sprint?








## Support hero this sprint


<!-- https://posthog.pagerduty.com/schedules#PPLGE4G -->


Week 1: Alex


Week 2: Ben





## Plan: Proposed Goals for Next Sprint 





Each goal should have a single owner. Owner can only be an engineer.





1. s3 backed recordings @rcmarron 


why: Make sure we can retain sessions + not blow up clickhouse


2. turbo mode wrap up @neilkakkar 


why: immediate evaluation of feature flags rather than waiting for /decide


3. Session Recordings Experience enhancement â€” Event list @alexkim205 


why: Better/more fine grained experience, more parity with events


4. Person on events rollout @EDsCODE 


why: make our much queries faster


5. Switch over events to EKS and set ECS to 0 - @guidoiaquinti 


why: infrastructure parity between self hosted and cloud


6. ""Right to be forgotten"" tooling - make deleting person/groups/teams data easy @macobo


Why: GDPR compliance is one of our strengths (for self-hosted) and person-on-events is closing completion - we need proper tooling to make sure we can delete data still without killing performance.


7. Implement ""fundamental"" Design System components @benjackwhite 


why: design system will help us move faster


8. Low hanging fruit for visualisations https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/11106 @Twixes 


why: Small fixes around visualisations will improve retention

## Description


GDPR payment regulations state that all businesses that collect/process personal data of customers from Europe need to comply with the regulatory requirements. GDPR protects customersâ€™ privacy by empowering the customer with the ownership of their personal data and thereby enabling them to  dictate how their personal data should be handled by those who collected it


customer delete call also delete all the data associated with that customer

Steps to reproduce the problem: 
1. Enable GDPR in the backend
2. Register as a new user
3. Request account deletion
4. Go to the QueuedEmails, see that there is no emails in there.

Living and working in Germany constantly exposes us to GDPR. Recently we had a customer try out the GDPR deletion of customers. Our customer expected that the user would be instantly deleted and be unable to login to the store instantly. We were able to explain our customer that this might not be the right behavior, because of open, unpaid orders in example. 

After that explanation, we and the customer, understand that manual review of the GDPR deletion requests is required. After checking the code we found out, that there is no email send out to the store owner when somebody requests their deletion. 

At this point, it's only possible to identify if a user wants to be deleted by accidentally visiting the GDPR log page in the backend. As there can also be many other GDPR logs in this table, beside customer deletion requests, it is then required to search for a special text to identify users that need to be reviewed and eventually deleted.

This is a time consuming and error prone setup. Additionally GDPR requires us to process the deletion requests in a timely manner. That's why we would expect that the store owner receives an deletion request email, so he can take immediate action.",GDPR,GDPR,right to erasure,right to erasure,right to erasure,7

For each property of each event it adds what kind of data they contain and for what reason the data is collected.





# How the annotations work





Let's assume we send the following event and the timer data is dynamic, i.e. the properties of `timer` can not known statically:


```ts


logEvent('E1', {


    E1P1: 'activitybar',


    ...f1,


    ...f4,


    timer: {


        waited: 536,


        processing: 43,


        queued: 97,


        elasped: 812


    }


});


```





The event is constructed in multiple steps, normally scattered across several files:


```ts


function logEvent(eventName, eventData) {


    eventData.CP1 = getSQMUserId();


    service.sendEvent(eventName, eventData);


}





let f1 : F1 = { F1P1 : 23 };





let f2 : F2 = { F2P1 : document.getLine(1) };


 


let f3 : F3 = { F3P1: publisher.displayName };





let f4 : F4 = {


    F4P1: extension.extensionName,


    F4P2: {


        ...f2,


        ...f3


    }


};





logEvent('E1', {


    E1P1: 'activitybar',


    ...f1,


    ...f4,


    timer: {


        waited: 536,


        processing: 43,


        queued: 97,


        elasped: 812


    }


});


```





In order to extract the event descriptions with simple scanners we use specific comments to describe telemetry events and their properties. We place those comments as close as possible to where the events and properties are generated. The code above would be annotated as follows:


```ts


// __GDPR__COMMON__ ""CP1"" : { ""endPoint"": ""SqmUserId"", ""classification"": ""EndUserPseudonymizedInformation"", ""purpose"": ""BusinessInsight"" }


function logEvent(eventName, eventData) {


    eventData.CP1 = getSQMUserId();


    service.sendEvent(eventName, eventData);


}





/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F1"" : {


      ""F1P1"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


   }


 */


let f1 : F1 = { F1P1 : 23 };





/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F2"" : {


      ""F2P1"" : { ""classification"": ""CustomerContent"", ""purpose"": ""PerformanceAndHealth"" }


   }


 */


let f2 : F2 = { F2P1 : document.getLine(1) };


 


/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F3"" : {


      ""F3P1"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


   }


 */


let f3 : F3 = { F3P1: publisher.displayName };





/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F4"" : {


      ""F4P1"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicNonPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F4P2"": { 


          ""${inline}"": [


              ""${F2}"",


              ""${F3}""


            ] 


        }


   }


 */


let f4 : F4 = {


    F4P1: extension.extensionName,


    F4P2: {


        ...f2,


        ...f3


    }


};





/* __GDPR__


   ""E1"" : {


      ""E1P1"" : { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""${include}"": [ 


          ""${F1}"",


          ""${F4}""


        ],


      ""${wildcard}"": [


         {


            ""${prefix}"": ""timer."",


            ""${classification}"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


         }


      ]


   }


 */


logEvent('E1', {


    E1P1: 'activitybar',


    ...f1,


    ...f4,


    timer: {


        waited: 536,


        processing: 43,


        queued: 97,


        elasped: 812


    }


});


```





The comments are processed and result in the following ""final"" description of the `E1` event. Every property that starts with `timer.` such as `timer.waited` is classified as system metadata that is collected for gaining insights into how the feature is being used.


```json


   ""E1"" : {


      ""E1P1"" : { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F1P1"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F4P4"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicNonPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F4P2.F2P1"" : { ""classification"": ""CustomerContent"", ""purpose"": ""PerformanceAndHealth"" },


      ""F4P2.F3P1"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""${wildcard}"": [


         {


            ""${prefix}"": ""timer."",


            ""${classification}"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


         }


      ],


      ""CP1"" : { ""endPoint"": ""SqmUserId"", ""classification"": ""EndUserPseudonymizedInformation"", ""purpose"": ""BusinessInsight"" }


   }


```





# More about the syntax


All GDPR comments are tagged with one of the following tags and are otherwise well-formed `JSON`.


- `__GDPR__` - describes the name and the properties of a telemetry event


- `__GDPR__FRAGMENT__` - describes the name and the properties of a fragment of the data of an event, fragments are either included or inlined by other fragments or events


- `__GDPR_COMMON__` - describes a property added to every telemetry event





Each property is described with an object that looks like this: 


```ts


{ 


    endPoint?: ""none"" | ""SqmUserId"" | ""SqmMachineId"",


    classification: ""SystemMetaData"" | ""CustomerContent"" | ""EndUserPseudonymizedInformation"" | ""PublicPersonalData"" | ""PublicNonPersonalData"",


    purpose: ""FeatureInsight"" | ""PerformanceAndHealth"" | ""BusinessInsight"" | ""SecurityAndAuditing"",


    isMeasurement?: Boolean


}


```





If `endPoint` is omitted, it defaults to `none`. That's appropriate for pretty much all properties with the exception of a couple of common properties.





The values for `classification` are mostly self-explaining. `EndUserPseudonymizedInformation` is what allows us to identify if two separate actions are performed by the same user, although we don't know who the user is. `machineId` or `instanceId` fall in this category. `PublicPersonalData` and `PublicNonPersonalData` is information that users provide us with, for example, publisher information on the marketplace. `CustomerContent` is information the user generated such as urls of repositories or custom snippets. Everything else is `SystemMetaData`.





`purpose` is usually `FeatureInsight` or `PerformanceAndHealth`. Only events generated by NPS surveys are sent to gain `BusinessInsight`.





`isMeasurement` is only used when describing properties that are added as custom measurements to events sent by VS Code extensions. 





## Special constructs


#### ${include}


If A includes B, this is equivalent to the union of A and B. Fragments are referenced using `${FragmentName}`.





#### ${inline}


If A inlines B at property P, all properties of B are added to A under the key `""P.<Name in B>""`. Fragments are referenced using `${FragmentName}`.





#### ${wildcard}


Wildcards can be used as a **temporary** workaround to describe dynamic properties that have a common prefix. In the long run all dynamic properties need to be removed and be sent as values of a static property. A wild card is an array of wildcard entries. Each entry has a `${prefix}` and a `${classification}` property. The value of `${prefix}` is a string representing the common prefix of all properties it matches. The value of `${classification}` is a property description detailed above.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,right to information,right to information,right to information,8

Scheme 0 is asking the user for the opt out decision for every new domain. It does not have any generalization. So, it is likely very unusable. Basically, Scheme 0 is an approximation of clicking on the Do Not Sell link at the bottom of homepages. Scheme 0 is more convenient than that, though, because it just requires one click and not putting in additional information, e.g., email, usernames, etc., that some real Do Not Sell link implementations require. So, Scheme 0 is at least as convenient as current Do Not Sell link implementations. 





On a side note, in real life not every domain is subject to the CCPA. Those domains that are not do not have a Do Not Sell link. But it is OK for us to ask for every domain, even if a domain does not have a Do Not Sell link, because we are simulating the future world where a privacy choice is possible on all domains. 





This is likely going to be very annoying for Scheme 0 participants. One way of dealing with this to not totally frustrate participants is to implement a mute button that mutes the banner popping up for a certain amount of time. I will open a separate issue on that.

We've added a new messenger message `passback-refresh` that is similar to the `passback` message, but simply sets the `passback` targeting and refreshes.

Added a new slot called `article-end` that will be shown at the end of article when the Epic doesn't.

Added an AB test to test the UX of the Public good slot and ads.

## Why?
We have a new vendor called ""Public Good"" which serves via a custom creative in GAM so that we can keep their third-party scripts in a safeframe.

The vendor will show in a new slot when the Epic doesn't appear.

However if they are not serving a campaign, or the user has selected the ""Do Not Sell"" CCPA consent option, they are not able so serve an ad so we refresh the slot to serve another ad or  collapse the slot.

The first issue prevented an start of our app when initializing the UserCentrics SDK and get the CCPA consent information in CCPA regions. It seems that the `optedOut` Flag of the `CCPAData` is nullable on the Native iOS and Adnroid SDKs, but was modeled as non-nullable boolean on the Dart side, which resulted in a fatal exception upon deserialization of the CCPA data received from the native side. The null value means that the user has not explicitly given or withdrawn the consent in CCPA regions.

The other change in the PR makes the two exceptions `FailedInitializationException` and `NotInitializedException` publicly available, because we had to programmatically react on exceptions of these type and did not want to to parse the error message of the exceptions, which might lead to unhandled exceptions in the future, when the error message provided by the exception might change.

Simplification of wording, opt out or complete removal","> Continuation: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3266 Apologies for posting in the wrong repository, I did not know that `advanced metric reporting` is restricted solely to `plugin.video.emby` and is not used anywhere else in the project.





Can I request the inclusion of options that allow Emby sysadmins to control in one central location all Emby uses of advanced metric reporting, aka Google analytics or alternatively that user data logging be removed from the project completely.





I have carefully worded this request to include all Emby uses of advanced metric reporting but my primary exposure to this has been surrounding the setting in the `Emby for Kodi Sync Add-On` https://emby.media/emby-for-kodi.html





As it stands each of my users are required to navigate to `Kodi > Addons > Emby > Configure > Advanced`  and disable ""analytics metrics logging"" on each of their profiles on each of their devices. This is impractical in general and impossible given the metrics are being collected are against my children who are all too young to understand any of this.





I would also like to request this setting be altered to use clearer wording explaining what it is as in my opinion the current wording does not naturally lend itself to informing users that data is being uploaded to the cloud for analysis.





Alternatively you may find it beneficial to consider removing all user data collection as you may not be aware of recent regulation changes covering to the collection of EU citizen data by any party worldwide. These changes are far reaching and amongst other things clear up the previous grey area of data being uploaded outside of the EU by non EU parties. This FAQ should help https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.htm and I would strongly recommend Emby LLC review this and instruct their authorised partners to do so too as compliance is mandatory and it has special regulations for children you will need to follow without delay.





Note: I seriously considered not raising this ticket in fear of it becoming some flag for nay sayers to rally behind. I would ask that people do not jump on this for anything other than technical or legal compliance as *Emby LLC and their authorised partners are absolutely within their rights to collect data* they just need to do it in the right way which unfortunately in a post GDPR world is a very complex and time-consuming task.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,right to opt-out,right to opt-out,right to opt-out,9

For GDPR (and some clients), we need to have the possibility to hide certain profile fields.





## Solution


On a settingspage we can now deny access to certain profile fields. Also for privacy reasons we add a 'nickname' field to the profile. This is only added when the module is turned on. In addition the field is disabled by default. Thus turning on the module doesn't do anything without changing some settings.

- Clicking on the UK data protection act opens a new tab. Also added an icon at the end of the string. All of this is done in the same localizable string (wording, link and icon). This way, the style will be the same no matter the language (hence the phrase lenght).

- Outline is black (`auto`) across the entire app. Agreed with Jana to standardize in black, later on we'll change the color of the outline app-wide (changing to #009DFF for this screen only will make the rest of the app inconsistent).

Jana's comments not addressed in the PR:
> 6. When I typed â€œwww.somethingâ€ as the url, I was able to save it without an error message. Next I tried â€œ2222â€ and got an error message, so it is doing some validation. I do think we should require a .com or a .org, or something of the sort to validate it.

After discussing with Jana and Dee, advanced validation attempts might exclude lots of valid urls. We will do basic validation and let the IWF one reject urls that makes no sense (if there's such a thing).

> 9. This is probably out of scope, but I was able to hit the button â€œsend another reportâ€ without saving the original CSAM report I was working on. Iâ€™d like us to show the alert dialog when we have a chance to add this in.

Will be addressed after the dialog is implemented (in edit case feature).",DPA,Data Protection Act,storage limitation,N/A,storage limitation,12

For the EU GDPR and other privacy laws, keeping logs only a limited amount of time (rather than a limited amount of overall data, like docker's `--log-opt max-buffer-size` allows) is essential to avoid fines for unnecessarily keeping sensitive data beyond a reasonable time window required for potential investigation of technical incidents.





Since this will affect a lot of those people who are using the docker engine directly (rather than an orchestrator like kubernetes) to run containers and manage their logs, I propose an option is added to handle this, e.g. `--log-opt max-buffer-days` or something. To handle this, docker would internally need to separate the log by days, so it can throw away not only based on overall log size but also based on age.





Sorry if such an option already exists, I made this ticket because I wasn't able to find it.





Edit: please note detailed ""throw away granularity""/small interval, or a super exact throw away time (beyond not exceeding the interval) is really not required for this option to fulfill this use case. So I don't think any advanced detail intervals or making sure it's not thrown away a day *early* in some corner cases is important, and the simplest implementation that doesn't have horrible performance is probably good enough.",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,storage limitation,storage limitation,storage limitation,12

I've been working with my colleague Dennis on some new features of our awesome ""Umbraco Forms on Steroids""-package to make it more GDPR-compliant. We have been working to realize some important parts of my blogpost and HTML mockup (https://skrift.io/articles/archive/i-have-a-nightmare-dream-about-umbraco-and-gdpr/, http://downloads.perplex.eu/umbraco/gdpr/settings2.html). 





Specifically we've been working on ""delete data after x period"" and encryption of the data.





The ""delete data after x period"" is already fixed with a workflow, and we will also do the encryption with a workflow. But when retrieving the data in the backoffice we have a problem and hopefully you can take a look shortly, so we can fix this and release the new and improved package. 





We hoped that we could decrypt the data when plugging into the event 





RecordStorage.RecordFetching += RecordStorage_RecordFetching;





So if we clicked on ""Entries"" in the backoffice forms-section this would get called and we could decrypt every record. But this isn't triggered and if we sneakpeek into the dll we see that the functions GetAllRecords and GetRecords in RecordStorage.cs do not dispatch this event (it does in GetRecord and GetRecordByUniqueID), and that is why we can't decrypt data.





Could you think for just a moment how we could achieve the decryption in the backoffice without rewriting whole parts of the work you've done?





=== 


Submitted a Ticket to ZenDesk and Dennis asked me to add this to the issue:





The change is fairly simple as it just involves dispatching the event in those two methods of RecordStorage.cs (you can leave a note for whoever picks up the issue that it's line 76 and 132).





I'd however like that someone with Forms knowledge verifies that this approach is okay and that we do not cause any performance issues by triggering this as separate single events for each record, instead of batching it up with a new event type.





I don't think there will be any major issues though, as we also currently fetch the data for every single record through a foreach loop but would just like to be sure ;)





=== 


Hopefully this can be fixed soon!

I strongly suggest you change the default lifetime of cookies created by Amplitude SDKs to match this requirement (12 months). Here is a screenshot of cookies created by Amplitude JS SDK atÂ https://nrn-v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty-c1-amplitude-g.vercel.app/fr

This single violation of the GDPR makes Amplitude non GDPR compliant (according to my attorney).





Also, I haven't found any way of changing that behavior through configuration of the JS SDK atÂ https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/javascript-sdk-reference, and I suggest such option gets added for people who'd have even stricter rules regarding cookies (or to gracefully handle any future change in the GDPR itself, regarding this particular matter).",GDPR,General Data Protection Regulation,storage limitation,storage limitation,storage limitation,12

This might be overkill, but it's at least worth an effort to investigate.





**This issue is related to issue #163**


It is also discussed on the Resonate Community board [here](https://community.resonate.coop/t/right-to-be-forgotten/2620).





TLDR:


1. Within the scope of Resonate's business operations, GDPR compliance can be considered ""common sense"" requirements. ""Common sense"", in this case, means the deletion of clearly identifying data, such as name / address / email , and so forth.


2. Data can be retained if it is of ""legitimate interest"" to Resonate (ie artist info / assets that have been purchased by other users of Resonate's platform, or similar circumstances where the retention of data supports Resonate's ongoing business operations).
