)"" param. 





AMP doesn't support that variable. The closest is the [`consentRequired`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-consent/#consentrequired) field. 


`consentRequired` doesn't work well because its value can be true when another regulations applies. Since AMP decided to support IAB TCF, I propose we introduce a new field to the CMP endpoint response ""gdprApplies"". The value will be stored along with the consent string and passed to ad vendors. 





```


{


  ""consentRequired"": {boolean}


  ""consentStateValue"": {?enum} [default: null]


  ""consentString"": {?string} [default: null]


  ""expireCache"": {boolean} [default: false]


  ""gdprApplies"": {boolean} [default to consentRequired value]


}


```





Note: AMP will use the ""consentRequired"" value if the ""gdprApplies"" is not defined. 





Important Notice:


AMP reduces the delay by always respecting the localStored value, and only updates it for the next user visit. That will apply to the ""gdprApplies"" value as well.","2020-03-11T01:12:17Z","2020-04-28T18:53:23Z","CCPA","CCPA"

1. On opening the dialog the first time, the initial preferences would not be reflected in the UI


2. Hit 'cancel'


3. On opening the dialog the second time, the initial preferences are now reflected





This was purely a UI bug, and initial preferences were still respected by `analytics.js`. The root of the issue was that the `preferences` object passed to the dialog component on _initialization_ was incorrect, but the object would be corrected on ""Cancel"" or any interaction with the dialog - correcting the issue the 2nd time the dialog was opened.

A couple others things are done in this PR:


- Introduced the API interface for the CCPA events (hollowed out)


- Removed 2 unused SVG code files (Logo & ArrowRight)

- Implement CCPA's event listeners behind our own `onIabConsentNotification`


- Expand `shouldShow` so it returns a value based on the correct conditions when CCPA in enabled (right now it returns based on TCF conditions only)

According to the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G201.html), the use of this icon is not only for external links. 





> The objective of this technique is to provide a warning before automatically opening a new window or tab. Opening new windows automatically when a link is activated can be disorienting for people who have difficulty perceiving visual content, and for some people with cognitive disabilities, if they are not warned in advance. Providing a warning allows the user to decide it they want to leave the current window, and the warning will help them find their way back, if they do decide they would like to go to the new window. It will help them understand that the ""back"" button will not work and that they have to return to the last window they had open, in order to find their previous location.





The content for this icon should be revised to accurately speak to its intent. 





It is my opinion that this UI icon was co-opted for the use of the CCPA and other privacy concerns. This is not the intent of the icon, but there is much debate as to what is. In this issue, I will try to provide as many resources and references as possible to allow for a reasonable conclusion.","2020-07-02T23:30:25Z","2021-06-26T22:02:20Z","CCPA","CCPA"

Issue





## Description


CCPA Prebid is not bidding as expected





## Steps to reproduce


1.  CCPA Consent Management module was added to v2.44.0 Prebid. 





2. When we debugged the Prebid, we did notice the Prebid loading but there is no bidresponses or bidrequests. 








## Sites with the issue: 


https://www.hometalk.com/?fc=8643,8856 as well as https://www.hometalk.com





### Expected results : There should be bid responses as well as requests coming in. 





### Actual results: There are not bid responses or requests from the CCPA Prebid.

Hopefully you can review and approve.





I'm updating this repo and the Antora docs (will send a separate PR) with a cookie preference center upgrade that now uses geo-location to present users in California with a different cookie experience. Also because the Cloudstate website now clearly references Lightbend in the header banner of the homepage, I've updated the Privacy Policy link in the footer to point at the Lightbend.com privacy policy. Before we just had a clone of the LB policy over here, no need to have two anymore. 





I've also added a cookie listing page, that lists cookies used on thew cloudstate.io domain.

iOS currently is communicating with SSR articles to implement doesCcpaApply() to effectively render CCPA footer content for US residents.





## Changes





- Added a timeOut delay for async - a delay to allow time for the the data to be parsed and processed to `bridget` before reading the boolean value from `article.ts`


- Added Privacy settings in footer when CCPA not present

## What does this change?


This change adds CMP-related timers to `EventTimer`, allowing us to send SourcePoint timers to the data lake.





CMP events are not tracked by `EventTimer`'s `trigger` function (see example [here](https://github.com/guardian/consent-management-platform/blob/c404fd68dc629525f4a70e25dfc97fc419a1eb97/src/tcfv2/sourcepoint.ts#L46)), so a static array including CMP event names has been added to to the fields of the `EventTimer` class, as well as a getter function that concatenates `EventTimer`'s private events to the external consent timers.





The tracked events are:


- `cmp-[framework]-init`


-  `cmp-[framework]-got-consent`





where `[framework]` is one of `tcfv2`, `ccpa`, or `aus`. 





Because CMP events are now included in `EventTimer`, no changes are needed to `sendCommercialMetrics`, so we will start seeing these new metrics flow into the lake when this PR is merged.





## Why?


Tracking CMP timers will give us a better understanding of how SP metrics relate to commercial timers.","2021-06-15T11:36:39Z","2021-06-16T15:53:19Z","CCPA","CCPA"

Scheme 0 is asking the user for the opt out decision for every new domain. It does not have any generalization. So, it is likely very unusable. Basically, Scheme 0 is an approximation of clicking on the Do Not Sell link at the bottom of homepages. Scheme 0 is more convenient than that, though, because it just requires one click and not putting in additional information, e.g., email, usernames, etc., that some real Do Not Sell link implementations require. So, Scheme 0 is at least as convenient as current Do Not Sell link implementations. 





On a side note, in real life not every domain is subject to the CCPA. Those domains that are not do not have a Do Not Sell link. But it is OK for us to ask for every domain, even if a domain does not have a Do Not Sell link, because we are simulating the future world where a privacy choice is possible on all domains. 





This is likely going to be very annoying for Scheme 0 participants. One way of dealing with this to not totally frustrate participants is to implement a mute button that mutes the banner popping up for a certain amount of time. I will open a separate issue on that.

## What does this change?


This is a fix for the failing ccpa tests. The __uspapi.getUSPData function, in the source point sdk, no longer returns a consistent 'gpcEnabled' property to test. However, the GPC signal is respected when testing manually. This update tests whether the banner is shown or hidden when the gcp header, 'Sec-GPC' is set to 0 or 1.

This removes the broken (and unnecessary) monitoring for setting the Sec-gpc header value to 0.


Added linting fixes too.





## Why?


The ccpa monitoring started breaking for the method that sets the Sec-gpc header to 0 and checks the banner appears after the last Sourcepoint release.  On investigation the value should only ever be 1 to turn the GPC Signal on for the user - but non-existent if it's off.

We've added a new messenger message `passback-refresh` that is similar to the `passback` message, but simply sets the `passback` targeting and refreshes.

Added a new slot called `article-end` that will be shown at the end of article when the Epic doesn't.

Added an AB test to test the UX of the Public good slot and ads.

## Why?
We have a new vendor called ""Public Good"" which serves via a custom creative in GAM so that we can keep their third-party scripts in a safeframe.

The vendor will show in a new slot when the Epic doesn't appear.

However if they are not serving a campaign, or the user has selected the ""Do Not Sell"" CCPA consent option, they are not able so serve an ad so we refresh the slot to serve another ad or  collapse the slot.

Resolves https://github.com/dust-tt/dust/issues/3351.

This PR fulfills the necessary steps to make our Dust App available within the Atlassian community, enabling everyone to link their Confluence (and soon Jira) accounts with Dust. As part of the app-sharing prerequisites, we must adhere to Atlassian's GDPR guidelines (see [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/user-privacy-developer-guide/#user-privacy-guide-for-app-developers)).

The specified endpoint, `/app/report-accounts`, takes a list of user account IDs and their oldest updated times and determines whether we can retain those accounts' data in our infrastructure. If an account is deactivated, we are required to purge all its associated data. This account status check must be conducted every 7 days.

To comply with the 7-day cycle, this PR introduces a Temporal schedule. This schedule will trigger a routine to verify the status of all user accounts. Additionally, we will implement checks in production to guarantee the proper execution of this schedule.

The first issue prevented an start of our app when initializing the UserCentrics SDK and get the CCPA consent information in CCPA regions. It seems that the `optedOut` Flag of the `CCPAData` is nullable on the Native iOS and Adnroid SDKs, but was modeled as non-nullable boolean on the Dart side, which resulted in a fatal exception upon deserialization of the CCPA data received from the native side. The null value means that the user has not explicitly given or withdrawn the consent in CCPA regions.

The other change in the PR makes the two exceptions `FailedInitializationException` and `NotInitializedException` publicly available, because we had to programmatically react on exceptions of these type and did not want to to parse the error message of the exceptions, which might lead to unhandled exceptions in the future, when the error message provided by the exception might change.

This PR replaces pull request #81. It would be good if the change could merged bak to the main repository soon, so we can switch back to your repository and do not have to maintain our own fork.","2024-01-25T08:40:33Z","2024-01-25T13:28:59Z","CCPA","CCPA"

The backend system must support a comprehensive set of functionalities to manage user accounts effectively. Here's a detailed list of the required functionalities:
### User Registration
- [x] #141
- **Endpoint for Account Creation**: A secure API endpoint to register new users. It should collect essential information like username, email, and password. 
- [x] #140

- **Email Verification**: After registration, send a verification email to the user to validate their email address, enhancing account security.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure all user input is validated for format and uniqueness (e.g., email and username) to prevent invalid data entry.

## 2. Login
- **Authentication Endpoint**: A secure login API that authenticates users based on their credentials (username/email and password).
- **Session Management**: Create and manage user sessions, providing a token (e.g., JWT) for accessing authorized endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting on Login Attempts**: To prevent brute force attacks, implement rate limiting on login attempts from the same IP address.

## 3. Profile Editing
- **Profile Update Endpoint**: Allow users to update their profile information, including personal details like name, contact information, and profile pictures.
- **Password Change Functionality**: Securely enable users to change their passwords, including current password verification and strong password enforcement.
- **Data Validation**: Validate changes to ensure that email addresses, if editable, remain unique and personal information adheres to format requirements.

## 4. Account Deletion
- **Deletion Endpoint**: Provide a secure method for users to delete their accounts, requiring re-authentication or password confirmation to prevent unauthorized deletions.
- **Data Handling**: Define how the user's data is handled post-deletion, ensuring compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR). This may involve permanently removing user data or anonymizing it for record-keeping.

## Security and Compliance
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data, especially passwords, must be encrypted using robust algorithms (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing).
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all API endpoints use HTTPS to secure data in transit.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data protection and privacy regulations to protect user information and rights.

Implementing these backend functionalities provides a solid foundation for user account management, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.

The User class represents a registered user in the system. Users should be able to perform the following actions:","2024-02-15T07:37:58Z","2024-02-15T16:33:20Z","CCPA","CCPA"

### Current Behavior

### Expected Behavior

### How to Reproduce

Unfortunately, I can't reproduce it on my end. The crash reports are from Crashlytics. It does happen to a small fraction of users about 100 a day.

One interesting observation is that almost all users experiencing this bug have not granted the GDPR consent. I use `ConsentForm.loadConsentForm()` to get the users consent like described here [Admob Documentation](https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/eu-consent) After the consent is observed Applovin is initialised via `AppLovinMAX.initialize(""key"")`.

Suite à de récentes modifications sur le sujet, on remonte désormais uniquement la dernière session **publiée** d'un élève à une certification (plutôt que toutes, éliminant ainsi les doublons).
Cela a introduit une régression : au cours d'une année un élève est parfois inscrit à plusieurs sessions, mais s'il réussit la première de l'année il ne va pas forcèment en rattrapage. Mais le rattrapage reste publié.
Il faut donc prendre en compte la dernière session publiée certes, mais à laquelle le candidat est **entré en certification**
A noter que l'on veut l'état actuel, c'est à dire que si un élève est entré plusieurs fois en certification, c'est bien la dernière entrée en certification que l'on veut.

## :robot: Proposition

* Limiter la remontée des identifiants de candidats au candidats qui sont rentrés en certification.

## :rainbow: Remarques

⚠️ Pour des raisons de GDPR, on part aussi uniquement des données de certification, et on évite de passer par la table qui donne beaucoup d'informations personnelles d'un candidat. Cela pour préparer le terrain à terme d'une séparation encore plus forte à venir de ces données du reste des données.

## :100: Pour tester

* Créer 4 sessions SCO avec `certif-sco@example.net`, y inscrire dans toutes ces sessions **un même élève** (même organization-learner)
* Faire rentre dans la session 1 le candidat, passer la session, réussir la certification, finaliser et publier la session
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des résultats, y constater la certification **validée** pour l'élève
* Lancer la session numéro 2, faire passer le même élève, et terminer vite son test (qu'importe son statut, faites le échouer, au pire vous le rejeterez pour fraude), finaliser et publier la session
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des résultats, y constater la certification **rejetée** pour l'élève
* Lancer la session numéro 3, **ne pas faire entrer le candidat en session**, finaliser et publier la session
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des résultats, y constater la certification **rejetée** pour l'élève (le résultat numéro 2)
* Lancer la session numéro 4, faire rentrer le candidat en session, réussir la certification, finaliser  **mais ne publiez pas** la session
  * Cas particulier, on a  donc un candidat, avec un résultat, mais pas encore publié
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des résultats, y constater la certification **rejetée** pour l'élève (le résultat numéro 2)
* Maintenant publiez la session numéro 4
* Aller sur Pix Orga avec `orga-sco-managing-students@example.net` , aller dans certifications pour extraire la liste des résultats, y constater la certification **validée** pour l'élève (le résultat numéro 4)

- todo : créer un orga-learner lié à la 1èreA, l'inscrire à une session, ne pas le faire passer et vérifier dans l'export de de résultats qu'il n'apparaît pas. Puis le faire rejeter et voir que l'attestation ne le retourne pas.

En principe après tout cela c'est déjà l'heure du goûter.","2024-02-29T13:17:47Z","2024-03-01T09:38:21Z","CCPA","CCPA"

Refactor the GDPR service dry-run to not return a list of applications. Instead, return true if the information can be deleted and throw an exception if it can't. This also means that the delete call needs to be refactored to not receive a list of applications, but fetch them from the DB again.

Besides supporting both the old and Kortisto model of GDPR service, this also has the added benefit of loading the information to be deleted in the same transaction as they are deleted in, so there's no chance of the information changing between the loading and deleting.

Implement the canDelete method for `KortistoGdprService`. This checks that the user is not on any active applications, and is not the only admin user (user with KAIKKI_OIKEUDET privileges) in the hanke. If the user shouldn't be deleted, all the conflicting applications are gathered and thrown in an exception. The controller returns the errors in the correct format to Profiili.

## Because
<!-- Summarize the purpose or reasons for this PR, e.g. what problem it solves or what benefit it provides. -->
The more styles lesson lacks an assignment section, which is required as part of the style guide.  It also has some strong language about Google fonts that needs to be moderated at bit.  Additionaly the admin dashboard project references using google fonts, so a link back to more text would help.

## This PR
<!-- A bullet point list of one or more items describing the specific changes. -->
- Refactor lesson to comply with style guide
- Rewrite GDPR information to be more neutral
- Adds some new links as assignments and additional resources.
- Add a link back to the more text lesson in the admin dashboard project
- Several linting changes to admin dashboard project.

<!-- Add a description of work done here -->
This makes Codepen embeds opt-in, since it's unclear whether loading them by default is allowed under GDPR. This does not include a mechanism to revoke consent, since it's also unclear how to do so. Deleting the value from local storage that tracks consent wouldn't do anything about the third-party cookies. Once I have clarification from Codepen, I'll follow up on this.

We are proposing two significant updates to our email system: firstly, to refactor our current resend notification templates using React-email components for better maintainability and scalability, and secondly, to implement a welcome email feature that automatically triggers when a new user signs up.

## Current Implementation
Our current email templates, including resend notifications, utilize inline CSS styles within standard React components. This approach has limitations in email client compatibility and maintainability.

## Proposed Changes
1. **Refactor Email Templates**: Transition our existing email templates to utilize React-email components, ensuring improved compatibility across email clients and easier maintenance.
2. **Implement Welcome Email**: Develop and integrate an automatic welcome email to enhance user engagement immediately upon registration.

## Objectives
- Improve email client compatibility and maintainability of our email templates.
- Enhance user experience and engagement through immediate communication post-registration.
## Requirements
- **Refactoring**:
  - Integrate the React-email library.
  - Rewrite existing templates to use React-email components.
- **Welcome Email**:
  - Design and develop content that aligns with our brand and is responsive across devices.
  - Automate the email dispatch upon user registration.

## Tasks
1. **Evaluate and Integrate React-email Library**: Incorporate the library into our project for building email templates.
2. **Redesign Email Templates**: Use React-email components to rewrite the resend notification and develop the welcome email template.
3. **Develop Email Content**: Ensure the content for both emails is engaging, informative, and brand-consistent.
4. **Automate Email Dispatch**: Integrate email sending functionality into the registration workflow.
5. **Testing and Compatibility Checks**: Test email rendering across different email clients like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.
6. **Update Documentation**: Reflect changes in the email development process and setup in our project documentation.
7. **Monitor Performance**: Track open rates and user feedback for the welcome email to gauge its effectiveness.

## Expected Outcomes
- By using React-email components, we anticipate reduced overhead in maintaining email styles and enhanced reliability across various platforms.
- The welcome email is expected to increase user satisfaction and engagement, potentially reducing churn and fostering platform adoption.

## Additional Resources
- React-email documentation: [Link to React-email documentation]
- Example implementations or guides for email template development and user engagement strategies.

## Risks and Challenges
- Ensure seamless integration of React-email without impacting current email functionalities.
- Compliance with GDPR, CAN-SPAM Act, and other relevant legal standards.
- Conduct A/B testing to optimize the email impact based on analytics and user feedback.

Combining these issues into a cohesive project allows for streamlined development and testing, ensuring consistency across our email communications and enhancing overall user experience.","2024-04-29T07:22:19Z","2024-05-04T13:05:08Z","CCPA","CCPA"

Currently VIVO uses the Google Fonts API. And although a legal complaint campaign about this failed in Austria not too long ago, it can be assumed that this is not GDPR-compliant. If I see this correctly, the only compliant solution would be to host the fonts locally.

Closes #424

Adds integration with the [WP Consent API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-consent-api/) plugin to better support different consent banner configurations.

If the plugin is installed on a website then the existing consent state will be sent as an update when [tracking is initialised](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/blob/4c3a0362f33b32f755884b0c03c338f7a1f71b1a/assets/js/src/index.js#L26). For on-page updates, we're [adding an event listener](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/blob/4c3a0362f33b32f755884b0c03c338f7a1f71b1a/assets/js/src/index.js#L60) for `wp_listen_for_consent_change` which is dispatched by WP Consent API when any changes are made.

### Detailed test instructions:

#### General test instruction

1. Build extension from `add/424-integration-with-wp-consent-api`
2. Install [Complianz](https://wordpress.org/plugins/complianz-gdpr/) and setup a basic consent banner
3. Debug the site using [Tag Assistant](https://tagassistant.google.com/) while logged out
4. Grant consent via consent banner
5. Confirm a `Consent` event is sent with the updated state
6. Trigger events on page i.e visit the shop archive, visit a single product, add a product to cart
7. Confirm the events are all recorded in Tag Assistant and that the consent `On-page Update` is `Granted` (_Under the Consent tab_)
    <img width=""1680"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-05-20 at 17 50 37"" src=""https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/assets/40762232/5f1bcd1d-b283-49df-a2e5-a3c97168c531"">
8. Revoke consent via the consent banner
9. Confirm that the consent state is no longer `Granted` in Tag Assistant


#### Event order testing

By default, the WP Consent API plugin JavaScript loads in the footer meaning we are unable to send the consent update event with the current state until after the page loads.

We need to support calls to `gtag` from on the page for Google Listings & Ads and other third-party extensions. To do that we're including the `wait_for_update` parameter as [recommended by Google](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?consentmode=advanced#async) so that events sent before the consent update will still be recorded. 57ec41e

1. Trigger an event on the page
```php
add_action(
	'wp_head',
	function() {
		echo '<script>gtag( ""event"", ""example_event"" );</script>';
	}
);
```
2. Visit the site while debugging via Tag Assistant with consent `Granted`
    1. Confirm the event is sent before the consent update
    2. View the `Consent` tab and confirm that the `On-page Update` is listed as `Granted`

**Without `wait_for_update`:**

### Additional details:

- Another option was to add the existing consent state to the `ga4w` data object so that immediately after we set the consent defaults the update can be sent. While this would be preferable, caching and minification plugins would cause problems with it which is why we're relying on a purely JS implementation instead
- **Tests will be added in a follow-up PR**

 - Uses [NiiVue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue) for loading and visualization. This allows drag and drop support for voxel formats including [NIfTI](https://brainder.org/2012/09/23/the-nifti-file-format/), [NRRD](http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html), [MRtrix MIF](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/image_data.html#mrtrix-image-formats), [AFNI HEAD/BRIK](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/README.attributes.html), [MGH/MGZ](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/MghFormat), [ITK MHD](https://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/MetaIO/Documentation#Reading_a_Brick-of-Bytes_.28an_N-Dimensional_volume_in_a_single_file.29), [ECAT7](https://github.com/openneuropet/PET2BIDS/tree/28aae3fab22309047d36d867c624cd629c921ca6/ecat_validation/ecat_info) as well as limited DICOM support.
 - Allows models to be run either on the main thread (as before) or a web worker. In theory, web workers allow more interactive main threads, and are faster as delays are not required and there are no concurrent tasks. In practice, both methods play a role: [Safari does not yet support TFJS web workers](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/8267) and in practice web workers appear to have fewer resources (e.g. heap memory). 
 - Allows classifications to be edited by drawing to append or erase voxels.
 - Allows entires scenes (images, classification results, contrast, crosshair position, drawings) to be saved as NiiVue documents that can be opened anywhere.
 - Removes all Python dependencies (pyodide) and replaces these functions with native JavaScript.
 - Replaces Papaya and ThreeJS dependencies with NiiVue.
 - Dramatically reduces peak heap memory usage (for low memory 104 region model the reduction is x173).
 - Reduces static memory usage.
 - Numerous optimizations increase performance.

To do:
 - Once accepted, a few parts of the [wiki should be updated](https://github.com/neuroneural/brainchop/wiki/Local-Setup).
 - All current bitmap art (e.g. `Input3DEnhancements.gif`) show the older user interface, and these should be updated.
 - Currently allows user to send diagnostics rather than automatic telemetry. From some perspectives, this is a limitation. brainchop team should consider the ideal mechanism as well as [GDPR compliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).

## Commit message

[FEATURE] Add record list download presets

The modal to download selected data from a record listing
(Web > List) is enhanced to display a list of configured
presets.

These presets can be defined via page TSconfig or user
TSconfig. The listed columns take personal ""exclude
fields"" into consideration.

A preset definition looks like:

```
mod.web_list.downloadPresets {
    pages {
        10 {
            label = Test-Preset-1
            columns = uid, title, crdate, slug
        }

        20 {
            label = LLL:EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf:preset2.label
            columns = uid, title, slug
            identifier = some-identifier
        }
    }
}
```

Multiple presets for one table can exist, and as many
presets for as many tables as needed are possible.

Extensions can provide such preset definitions in their
`Configuration/page.tsconfig` file, or in Site Sets.

A new PSR-14 event `BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent`
allows to modify the list of presets as well.

A new PSR-14 event `BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent` allows
to modify the actual download data, replacing the old
hook usage of $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']
['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']
['customizeCsvHeader'] and $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']
['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']
['customizeCsvRow'].

These hooks have been deprecated and are scheduled for
removal with TYPO3 v14; the only public TYPO3
extension currently utilizing this hook is gridelements.

==========================================================
Deprecation: #103785 - Deprecate hooks for record download
==========================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

The previously used hooks
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
and
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`,
used to manipulate the download / export configuration of records, triggered
in the :guilabel:`Web > List` backend module, have been deprecated in favor of a
new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent`.

Details for migration and functionality can be found in :ref:`feature-102337-1715591178`

Impact
======

When the hook :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
or
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`
is executed, this will trigger a PHP deprecation warning.

The extension scanner will find possible usages with a weak match.

Affected installations
======================

All installations using
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
or
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`
are affected.


Migration
=========

The new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent`
can be used as a near drop-in replacement.

=====================================================================
Feature: #102337 - PSR-14 event for modifying record list export data
=====================================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

A new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent`
has been introduced to modify the result of a download / export initiated via
the :guilabel:`Web > List` module.

This replaces the
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvHeader']`
and
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SC_OPTIONS']['TYPO3\CMS\Recordlist\RecordList\DatabaseRecordList']['customizeCsvRow']`,
hooks, which have been :ref:`deprecated <deprecation-102337-1715591179>`.

The event allows to modify both body and header section of the data
dump, so it can e.g. be use to redact sepcific data for GDPR compliance,
transform / translate specific data, trigger creation of archives or web hooks,
log export access and more.

The event offers the following methods:

- :php:`getHeaderRow()`: Return the current header row of the dataset.
- :php:`setHeaderRow()`: Sets the modified header row of the dataset.
- :php:`getRecords()`: Returns the current body rows of the dataset.
- :php:`setRecords()`: Sets the modified body rows of the dataset.
- :php:`getRequest()`: Returns the PSR request context.
- :php:`getTable()`: Returns the name of the database table of the dataset.
- :php:`getFormat()`: Returns the the format of the download action (CSV/JSON).
- :php:`getFilename()`: Returns the name of the download filename (for browser output).
- :php:`getId()`: Returns the page UID of the download origin.
- :php:`getModTSconfig()`: Returns the active module TSconfig of the download origin.
- :php:`getColumnsToRender()`: Returns the list of header columns for the triggered download.
- :php:`isHideTranslations()`: Returns whether translations are hidden or not.

Example
=======

The corresponding event listener class:

..  code-block:: php

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace Vendor\MyPackage\Core\EventListener;

    use TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Attribute\AsEventListener;

    #[AsEventListener(identifier: 'my-package/record-list-download-data')]
    final readonly class DataListener
    {
        public function __invoke(BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent $event): void
        {
            // List of redactable fields.
            $gdprFields = ['title', 'author'];

            $headerRow = $event->getHeaderRow();
            $records = $event->getRecords();

            // Iterate header to mark redacted fields...
            foreach ($headerRow as $headerRowKey => $headerRowValue) {
                if (in_array($headerRowKey, $gdprFields, true)) {
                    $headerRow[$headerRowKey] .= ' (REDACTED)';
                }
            }

            // Redact actual content...
            foreach ($records as $uid => $record) {
                foreach ($gdprFields as $gdprField) {
                    if (isset($record[$gdprField])) {
                        $records[$uid][$gdprField] = '(REDACTED)';
                    }
                }
            }

            $event->setHeaderRow($headerRow);
            $event->setRecords($records);
        }
    }

Migration
=========

The functionality of both hooks (:php:`customizeCsvHeader` and
:php:`customizeCsvRow`) is now handled by the new PSR-14 event.

Migrating :php:`customizeCsvHeader`
-----------------------------------

The prior hook parameter/variable :php:`fields` is now available via
:php:`$event->getColumnsToRender()`. The actual record data
(previously :php:`$this->recordList`, submitted to the hook as its object
reference) is accessible via :php:`$event->getHeaderRow()`.

Migrating :php:`customizeCsvRow`
--------------------------------

The following prior hook parameters/variables have these substitutes:

- :php:`databaseRow` is now available via :php:`$event->getRecords()` (see note below).
- :php:`tableName` is now available via :php:`$event->getTable()`.
- :php:`pageId` is now available via :php:`$event->getId()`.

The actual record data
(previously :php:`$this->recordList`, submitted to the hook as its object
reference) is accessible via :php:`$event->getRecords()`.

Please note that the hook was previously executed once per row retrieved
from the database. The PSR-14 event however - due to performance reasons -
is only executed for the full record list after database retrieval,
thus allows post-processing on this whole dataset.

Impact
======

Using the PSR-14 event :php:`BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent` it's
now possible to modify all of the data available when downloading / exporting
a list of records via the :guilabel:`Web > List` module.

==========================================================================
Feature: #102337 - PSR-14 event for modifying record list download presets
==========================================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

A new PSR-14 event :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent`
has been introduced to manipulate the list of available download presets in
the :guilabel:`Web > List` module.

See :ref:`feature-102337-1712597691` for a detailed description of how to
utilize presets when downloading a set of records from the backend in CSV
or JSON format.

The event class offers the following methods:

- :php:`getPresets()`: Returns list of presets set via TSconfig
- :php:`setPresets()`: Sets a modified list of presets.
- :php:`getDatabaseTable()`: Returns the database table name that a preset applies to.
- :php:`getRequest()`: Returns the PSR Request object for the context of the request.
- :php:`getId()`: Returns the page ID of the originating page.

Note that the event is dispatched for one specific database table name. If
an event listener is created to attach presets to different tables, the
listener method must check for the table name, as shown in the example below.

If no download presets exist for a given table, the PSR-14 event can still
be used to modify and add presets to it via the :php:`setPresets()` method.

The array passed from :php:`getPresets()` to :php:`setPresets()` can contain
an array collection of :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\DownloadPreset`
objects with the array key using the preset label.
The existing presets can be retrieved with those getters:

- :php:`$preset->getLabel()`: Name of the preset (can utilize LLL translations), optional.
- :php:`$preset->getColumns()`: Array of database table column names.
- :php:`$preset->getIdentifier()`: Identifier of the preset (manually set or calculated based on label and columns)

The event listener can also remove array indexes, or also columns of existing
array entries by passing a newly constructed :php:`DownloadPreset` object with the
changed `label` and `columns` constructor properties.

Example
=======

The corresponding event listener class:

..  code-block:: php

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace Vendor\MyPackage\RecordList\EventListener;

    use TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\Event\BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Backend\RecordList\DownloadPreset;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Attribute\AsEventListener;

    #[AsEventListener(identifier: 'my-package/modify-record-list-preset')]
    final readonly class PresetListener
    {
        public function __invoke(BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent $event): void
        {
            $presets = $event->getPresets();

            switch ($event->getDatabaseTable()) {
                case 'be_users':
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('PSR-14 preset', ['uid','email']);
                    break;

                case 'pages':
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('PSR-14 preset', ['title']);
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('Another PSR-14 preset', ['title', 'doktype']);
                    break;

                case 'tx_myvendor_myextension':
                    $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('PSR-14 preset', ['uid', 'something']);
                    break;
            }

            $presets[] = new DownloadPreset('Available everywhere, simple UID list', ['uid']);

            $presets['some-identifier'] = new DownloadPreset('Overwrite preset', ['uid, pid'], 'some-identifier');

            $event->setPresets($presets);
        }
    }

Impact
======

Using the PSR-14 event :php:`BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent`
it's now possible to modify the available presets of each table for
downloading / exporting a list of such records via the :guilabel:`Web > List`
module.

=======================================================
Feature: #102337 - Presets for download of record lists
=======================================================

See :issue:`102337`

Description
===========

In the :guilabel:`Web > List` backend module, the data of records for each
database table (including pages and content records) can be downloaded.

This export takes the current selected list of columns into consideration and
alternatively allows to choose all columns.

A new feature has been introduced, adding the ability to pick the exported
data columns from a list of configurable presets.

Those presets can be configured via page TSconfig, and can also be
overridden via user TSconfig (for example, to expand certain presets
only to specific users).

..  code-block:: typoscript
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/page.tsconfig

    mod.web_list.downloadPresets {
        pages {
            10 {
                label = Quick overview
                columns = uid, title, crdate, slug
            }

            20 {
                identifier = LLL:EXT:myext/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf:preset2.label
                label = UID and titles only
                columns = uid, title
            }
        }
    }

Each entry of :typoscript:`mod.web_list.downloadPresets`
defines the table name on the first level (in this case `pages`), followed by
any number of presets.

Each preset contains a :typoscript:`label` (the displayed name of the preset,
which can be a locallang key), a comma-separated list of each column that
should be included in the export as :typoscript:`columns` and optionally
a :typoscript:`identifier`. In case :typoscript:`identifier` is not provided,
the identifier is generated as hash of the :typoscript:`label` and
:typoscript:`columns`.

This can be manipulated with user TSConfig by adding the :typoscript:`page.`
prefix. User TSConfig is loaded after page TSConfig, so you can overwrite
existing keys or replace the whole list of keys:

..  code-block:: typoscript
    :caption: EXT:my_extension/Configuration/user.tsconfig

    page.mod.web_list.downloadPresets {
        pages {
            10 {
                label = Quick overview (customized)
                columns = uid, title, crdate, slug
            }

            30 {
                label = Short with URL
                columns = uid, title, slug
            }
        }
    }

Since any table can be configured for a preset, any extension
can deliver a defined set of presets through the
:file:`EXT:my_extension/Configuration/page.tsconfig` file and
their table name(s).

Additionally, the list of presets can be manipulated via the new
:ref:`BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent <feature-102337-1715591177>`.

Impact
======

Editors can now export data with specific presets that match their need
as identified by the website maintainer or extension developer(s).

It is no longer required to pick specific columns to export over and over again,
and the list of presets is controlled by the website maintainer.

Two new PSR-14 Events have been added to allow further manipulation:

*  :ref:`BeforeRecordDownloadIsExecutedEvent <feature-102337-1715591177>`
*  :ref:`BeforeRecordDownloadPresetsAreDisplayedEvent <feature-102337-1715591178>`

As a contributor, I have found the lack of clear and comprehensive privacy policies somewhat frustrating. In today's digital age, where data security and privacy are paramount, not knowing how my personal information is being used or protected creates a sense of unease. This uncertainty can deter potential contributors from engaging fully, thereby limiting the community's growth and vibrancy.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
To address this concern, I respectfully suggest the implementation of more transparent and stringent privacy policies. This could include:

Detailed Privacy Policy: A clearly articulated privacy policy that explains how user data is collected, used, stored, and protected.
User Consent Mechanisms: Ensure that users explicitly consent to data collection and usage practices through opt-in mechanisms.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
 a user-friendly privacy dashboard where contributors can manage their data preferences and see what information is being stored.

**Additional context**
The need for enhanced privacy measures is underscored by the increasing number of data breaches and the growing concern among users about their digital footprint. Implementing robust privacy measures not only protects user data but also builds trust and loyalty, encouraging more active participation and contribution to the platform. It aligns with global standards and regulations such as GDPR, reinforcing the platform's credibility and commitment to user security.

- Given that a user has opted in to data sharing, when I query for their ID by email, then I get a record of the timestamp their consent was recorded and the ID of the consent type granted.
- Given that a user has NOT opted in to data sharing, when I query for their ID by email then I get an empty response or a “not found/404” and therefore now that I cannot process sensitive information.
- Given that a user has changed their opt-in status from consenting to data sharing to NOT consenting to data sharing, when I query for a their ID by email, then I get a record of the consent with a property which indicates they are opted out.","2022-10-12T05:34:17Z","2022-10-17T19:49:15Z","CPRA","CPRA"

Frankly, it's a blatant privacy violation.  It is actually illegal in most of the U.S. to record someone's phone conversations without first notifying them.  In the UK, the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) covers what can't be recorded.

- Clicking on the UK data protection act opens a new tab. Also added an icon at the end of the string. All of this is done in the same localizable string (wording, link and icon). This way, the style will be the same no matter the language (hence the phrase lenght).

- Outline is black (`auto`) across the entire app. Agreed with Jana to standardize in black, later on we'll change the color of the outline app-wide (changing to #009DFF for this screen only will make the rest of the app inconsistent).

Jana's comments not addressed in the PR:
> 6. When I typed “www.something” as the url, I was able to save it without an error message. Next I tried “2222” and got an error message, so it is doing some validation. I do think we should require a .com or a .org, or something of the sort to validate it.

After discussing with Jana and Dee, advanced validation attempts might exclude lots of valid urls. We will do basic validation and let the IWF one reject urls that makes no sense (if there's such a thing).

> 9. This is probably out of scope, but I was able to hit the button “send another report” without saving the original CSAM report I was working on. I’d like us to show the alert dialog when we have a chance to add this in.

Will be addressed after the dialog is implemented (in edit case feature).","2022-02-11T18:30:23Z","2022-02-21T16:46:13Z","DPA","Data Protection Act"

**Type**:


 


**Reference (Include section and paragraph number)**:


1.2

**Comment (Include rationale for comment)**:


The report states in sectiuon 1.2: ""While the schema in this document is intended to demonstrate the value of attribute metadata in supporting U.S. Federal Government use cases, the ideal metadata schema could be used in both commercial and public sector implementations, thus serving as a foundation to enable greater federation across markets and sectors. ""


However the description/definition of classification-metadata is written to accomodate Federal Government use cases.


 


**Suggested Change**:


Classification: ""The regulatory classification level of the attribute.""


For example, in the European Union, different regulations will apply to personal data such as the GDPR. In the Attribute metadata ""Allowed Values"", it can be made specific which regulatory classifications are applicable.





Probably the Releasability can be gneralised as well.





Another consideration would be if the classification-metadata is really attribute VALUE metadata or attribute metadata (on schema level).

To ensure protection of sensitive data, a few partners are asking for a functionality to set passwords on publicly shared dashboards. It's also in line with GDPR legislation that we need to help partners protect their sensitive data.





# Problem or idea





When a dashboard is shared publicly via the 'share' option, anyone who obtains the link can view it. That is not safe enough as some survey data might contain personal data of respondents like religion, sexual orientation etc. If this data (or visualisations) that can identify certain people or communities gets into the wrong hands, the respondents might be in danger or persecution. There are other cases of possible dashboard data mishandling too. 





# Solution or next step


Currently, the dashboard sharing window looks like that:


<img width=""986"" alt=""screen shot 2018-04-19 at 11 17 38"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21127166/38982885-51c8c480-43c3-11e8-8602-0deb57441e13.png"">


It should be enhanced with password setting functionality.

For each property of each event it adds what kind of data they contain and for what reason the data is collected.





# How the annotations work





Let's assume we send the following event and the timer data is dynamic, i.e. the properties of `timer` can not known statically:


```ts


logEvent('E1', {


    E1P1: 'activitybar',


    ...f1,


    ...f4,


    timer: {


        waited: 536,


        processing: 43,


        queued: 97,


        elasped: 812


    }


});


```





The event is constructed in multiple steps, normally scattered across several files:


```ts


function logEvent(eventName, eventData) {


    eventData.CP1 = getSQMUserId();


    service.sendEvent(eventName, eventData);


}





let f1 : F1 = { F1P1 : 23 };





let f2 : F2 = { F2P1 : document.getLine(1) };


 


let f3 : F3 = { F3P1: publisher.displayName };





let f4 : F4 = {


    F4P1: extension.extensionName,


    F4P2: {


        ...f2,


        ...f3


    }


};





logEvent('E1', {


    E1P1: 'activitybar',


    ...f1,


    ...f4,


    timer: {


        waited: 536,


        processing: 43,


        queued: 97,


        elasped: 812


    }


});


```





In order to extract the event descriptions with simple scanners we use specific comments to describe telemetry events and their properties. We place those comments as close as possible to where the events and properties are generated. The code above would be annotated as follows:


```ts


// __GDPR__COMMON__ ""CP1"" : { ""endPoint"": ""SqmUserId"", ""classification"": ""EndUserPseudonymizedInformation"", ""purpose"": ""BusinessInsight"" }


function logEvent(eventName, eventData) {


    eventData.CP1 = getSQMUserId();


    service.sendEvent(eventName, eventData);


}





/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F1"" : {


      ""F1P1"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


   }


 */


let f1 : F1 = { F1P1 : 23 };





/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F2"" : {


      ""F2P1"" : { ""classification"": ""CustomerContent"", ""purpose"": ""PerformanceAndHealth"" }


   }


 */


let f2 : F2 = { F2P1 : document.getLine(1) };


 


/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F3"" : {


      ""F3P1"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


   }


 */


let f3 : F3 = { F3P1: publisher.displayName };





/* __GDPR__FRAGMENT__


   ""F4"" : {


      ""F4P1"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicNonPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F4P2"": { 


          ""${inline}"": [


              ""${F2}"",


              ""${F3}""


            ] 


        }


   }


 */


let f4 : F4 = {


    F4P1: extension.extensionName,


    F4P2: {


        ...f2,


        ...f3


    }


};





/* __GDPR__

      ""E1P1"" : { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""${include}"": [

          ""${F4}""


        ],


      ""${wildcard}"": [


         {


            ""${prefix}"": ""timer."",


            ""${classification}"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


         }


      ]


   }


 */


logEvent('E1', {


    E1P1: 'activitybar',


    ...f1,


    ...f4,


    timer: {


        waited: 536,


        processing: 43,


        queued: 97,


        elasped: 812


    }


});


```





The comments are processed and result in the following ""final"" description of the `E1` event. Every property that starts with `timer.` such as `timer.waited` is classified as system metadata that is collected for gaining insights into how the feature is being used.


```json


   ""E1"" : {


      ""E1P1"" : { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F1P1"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F4P4"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicNonPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""F4P2.F2P1"" : { ""classification"": ""CustomerContent"", ""purpose"": ""PerformanceAndHealth"" },


      ""F4P2.F3P1"" : { ""classification"": ""PublicPersonalData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" },


      ""${wildcard}"": [


         {


            ""${prefix}"": ""timer."",


            ""${classification}"": { ""classification"": ""SystemMetaData"", ""purpose"": ""FeatureInsight"" }


         }


      ],


      ""CP1"" : { ""endPoint"": ""SqmUserId"", ""classification"": ""EndUserPseudonymizedInformation"", ""purpose"": ""BusinessInsight"" }


   }


```





# More about the syntax


All GDPR comments are tagged with one of the following tags and are otherwise well-formed `JSON`.


- `__GDPR__` - describes the name and the properties of a telemetry event


- `__GDPR__FRAGMENT__` - describes the name and the properties of a fragment of the data of an event, fragments are either included or inlined by other fragments or events


- `__GDPR_COMMON__` - describes a property added to every telemetry event





Each property is described with an object that looks like this: 


```ts


{ 


    endPoint?: ""none"" | ""SqmUserId"" | ""SqmMachineId"",


    classification: ""SystemMetaData"" | ""CustomerContent"" | ""EndUserPseudonymizedInformation"" | ""PublicPersonalData"" | ""PublicNonPersonalData"",


    purpose: ""FeatureInsight"" | ""PerformanceAndHealth"" | ""BusinessInsight"" | ""SecurityAndAuditing"",


    isMeasurement?: Boolean


}


```





If `endPoint` is omitted, it defaults to `none`. That's appropriate for pretty much all properties with the exception of a couple of common properties.





The values for `classification` are mostly self-explaining. `EndUserPseudonymizedInformation` is what allows us to identify if two separate actions are performed by the same user, although we don't know who the user is. `machineId` or `instanceId` fall in this category. `PublicPersonalData` and `PublicNonPersonalData` is information that users provide us with, for example, publisher information on the marketplace. `CustomerContent` is information the user generated such as urls of repositories or custom snippets. Everything else is `SystemMetaData`.





`purpose` is usually `FeatureInsight` or `PerformanceAndHealth`. Only events generated by NPS surveys are sent to gain `BusinessInsight`.





`isMeasurement` is only used when describing properties that are added as custom measurements to events sent by VS Code extensions. 





## Special constructs


#### ${include}


If A includes B, this is equivalent to the union of A and B. Fragments are referenced using `${FragmentName}`.





#### ${inline}


If A inlines B at property P, all properties of B are added to A under the key `""P.<Name in B>""`. Fragments are referenced using `${FragmentName}`.





#### ${wildcard}


Wildcards can be used as a **temporary** workaround to describe dynamic properties that have a common prefix. In the long run all dynamic properties need to be removed and be sent as values of a static property. A wild card is an array of wildcard entries. Each entry has a `${prefix}` and a `${classification}` property. The value of `${prefix}` is a string representing the common prefix of all properties it matches. The value of `${classification}` is a property description detailed above.","2017-09-25T21:54:57Z","2017-09-26T01:36:44Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

I set ""Capture Entries"" to disabled (for GDPR reasons) and there were already some entries saved. It's not necessarily a problem but when Capture Entries is enabled again the previous entries were still there. This could catch some people out as information from the form is still in the database which could mean the website is not compliant. Is it possible to have the option to clear the entries as you disable Capture Entries?

**Current situation**


Collected data and media are located in public folder and user and other apps can easily access them. The reason it is like this the ability to manually upload to flow the exported files. The user connect the device to the PC, browsers the device's filesystem and copies those files to the PC. She then uploads them via the dashboard.





**GDPR Compliant solution**


The collected files and media (images, videos...) will be kept in the app internal private storage by defaults. Only our app can access those files. If the user wants to export the files manually, shell will have to enable the export of these files to the public folder. 





**Sharing options**


1) Enable the the exporting of files once for all the surveys? In that case, we can have an entry inside settings which will enable this once and all the existing and future files will be public. 


2) Add a ""share"" entry to navigation drawer and then each time user presses it we will share/export all the existing collected data.


3) Add a ""share"" entry to navigation drawer which would display a list of all the existing files and user can select with a checkbox which ones she want to export.","2018-01-04T13:18:32Z","2018-06-06T19:07:14Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

As part of our GDPR work, we need to change the way we collect marketing consent.


Trello card [here](https://trello.com/c/dtlSHP3x/1156-marketing-consent-on-subscribe)


cc @jfsoul





## What needs to be done?


1. Change the wording of the consent form - TODO: this is undergoing some UX analysis but will be completed before launch.


2. Change the way that consent is persisted to Identity:





## How?


Previously we have stored marketing consent by posting to the user/me endpoint with a boolean representing whether the user checked the consent checkbox. Although we will continue to do this for now, Identity will soon start ignoring this value in favour of a [new API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDEpehzToi9aAMg4Fk7n_mnvQ_GOOf_kgOPSyWLBweA/)





### The new method


If user gives consent:


* We call Identity on the new consent-email endpoint to instruct them that the user has given consent to 'supporter' related emails. 


* Identity emails the user asking them to click a link to confirm their choice.





If user does not give consent then no call to the consent emailer is made.





### Guest users


For users who are not signed in during the checkout we create a guest user with Identity. The user then has the option to add a password on the thank you page. 





For users who do this and who have also given us marketing consent we now need to suppress the standard validation email which would otherwise be sent out when we set their password in Identity. 





This is described in more detail in [the doc mentioned above](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDEpehzToi9aAMg4Fk7n_mnvQ_GOOf_kgOPSyWLBweA/).

- User should be able to anonymize his/her data in the database so it cannot be linked to the person anymore





We were thinking about this with @suutari-ai that we could implement these two features into shuup inside `shuup.front.apps...` folder so they could be pluggable to projects which requires these features.

For GDPR (and some clients), we need to have the possibility to hide certain profile fields.





## Solution


On a settingspage we can now deny access to certain profile fields. Also for privacy reasons we add a 'nickname' field to the profile. This is only added when the module is turned on. In addition the field is disabled by default. Thus turning on the module doesn't do anything without changing some settings.

With #2505 we are introducing a page where Salim will be able to download his generated data exports from, instead of the emails. This change will help us: 


- be GDPR compliant; 


- stimulate more responsible data handling as data is not so easily shareable (not already in your email); 


- enable Salim to re-download the data export if he just wants the same file again 


- support a cleaner UI where information (status updates) are shared with Salim directly in the page he is in, without having to navigate to different parts of Flow or his email 





# Opportunity 





With these changes we also want to improve how we communicate to Salim that Flow cannot generate the data file, for one reason or the other. Currently we only say when file generation fails immediately using a pop up message right after Salim hits the Generate button. We do not tell Salim that the generation has stopped because of something ""wrong"" with the form structure, for example. 





# When can export generation fail and how quickly does Flow know





Generating a data file can fail for multiple reasons: 


- Flow services is down - we know right away 


- A question in the form does not have the question text - after a while: https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/issues/2433


- A bug in the report engine (that we did not find in testing) causes a crash.  


- if the Caddisfly test type was not selected (i think) 


- other.. 





# ~General failure~





~If Flow services is down for some reason, or generating the file fails right away we should show the message directly in the UI, where Salim is. This shows right away after hitting Generate.~

## Failure to generate for specific form 





If generating the file fails after a few seconds for a specific form related reason, we bring Salim to the Generated exports page and then show a form specific error message. This should hold the form name and reason for failure for Salim knows what he needs to change or adjust to make the export work.

In order to meet new GDPR requirements, we need to provide users with a link to the privacy policy on the sign up form and include a way to actively opt-in to our privacy policy. 





**A/C**





- [ ] The revised sign up form contains an explicit opt-in to privacy policy checkbox - **unchecked by default**.


- [ ] The revised sign up form contains an explicit opt-in to product and research communications checkbox - **checked by default**. covered in #431 


- [ ] Link to privacy and cookies policy in the acceptance language. e.g. ""I have read and agree to the privacy and cookies policy.""


- [ ] Copy linking to terms of service and community guidelines is appended to the opt-in to privacy policy checkbox string above( note: no tracking of opt-in to terms or community guidelines is needed - purely informational.)


- [ ] Sign up to Hypothesis is prevented if users do not accept the privacy policy and a tooltip is displayed with the text ""Acceptance of the privacy policy is required."" which points to the checkbox.





### Mock up

_Notes from @ajpeddakotla_ 





- This doesn't cover users that have already signed in. It only covers users that will be creating new accounts. 


- If users don't agree to our policy, they won't be able to create accounts. 


- We need to make sure everything we're linking to is fully available/accessible on our website.

One of the thing we need to do to be compliant is:





_With e-mail double opt-in, a new user first needs to verify their e-mail address before completing the sign-up process._





I've tried to prevent doing this on Monica since the beginning - not because I wanted to collect your email address and do nasty thing with it, but because I wanted people to sign up with fake email addresses if they wanted to.





This law will force us to confirm email addresses on signup.





We will create a new `.env` variable, called `SIGNUP_DOUBLE_OPTIN`, which will default to `TRUE`. On our hosted version, it will be set to true, but you will do whatever you want on your own instance.





Note: to be clear, we do have an email newsletter, but we only contact people who have subscribed manually and specifically to receive this newsletter. The email address used on signup is never used otherwise, other than sending reminder emails.





Changes to do:


- [ ] Create a email confirmation process


- [ ] Keep track of when the user has validated his email address


- [ ] Display this information in the Settings panel under a new section (called `Compliance`)


- [ ] Add a method in the User object, something like `isCompliant`, that will tell if users have confirmed emails and accepted Terms & Privacy. If not, we should block email sending (reminders, notifications,...) automatically. This will be done in https://github.com/monicahq/monica/issues/1184 so you don't have to do it here.

This new regulation comes with very high potential sanctions: up to 20 Million EUR or 4% of a years revenue, depending on which is _higher_.





This also poses some questions on whether DokuWiki is GDPR-compliant (and what does that even mean?):





- [ ] If a user deletes their account, do we have to delete their username from changelogs/meta?


  - Question asked here: https://law.stackexchange.com/q/27795/17677


  - [ ] Would that potentially conflict with the license, if that license requires attribution?


- [ ] Do we have to delete IP-addresses from changelogs, maybe after some time?


  - [ ] Can we do that in a way that still lets us tell different anonymous users apart from each other?


- [ ] Do we need to show some message / do we need some legally worded user opt-in for some things? (Subscriptions?)


- [ ] Do we need a Privacy Statement for DokuWiki.org?


  - [ ] should we provide examples other users can adjust?


  - [ ] would it be desirable to extend that with technology (eg. automatically list what data is collected when, why and how long) and provide a way for plugins to hook into that?





Maybe some of you have expertise in this matter or work in a company with legal resources to answer such questions -- Input would be greatly appreciated 🙏","2018-04-19T12:51:42Z","2018-05-29T11:05:00Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

For the EU GDPR and other privacy laws, keeping logs only a limited amount of time (rather than a limited amount of overall data, like docker's `--log-opt max-buffer-size` allows) is essential to avoid fines for unnecessarily keeping sensitive data beyond a reasonable time window required for potential investigation of technical incidents.





Since this will affect a lot of those people who are using the docker engine directly (rather than an orchestrator like kubernetes) to run containers and manage their logs, I propose an option is added to handle this, e.g. `--log-opt max-buffer-days` or something. To handle this, docker would internally need to separate the log by days, so it can throw away not only based on overall log size but also based on age.





Sorry if such an option already exists, I made this ticket because I wasn't able to find it.





Edit: please note detailed ""throw away granularity""/small interval, or a super exact throw away time (beyond not exceeding the interval) is really not required for this option to fulfill this use case. So I don't think any advanced detail intervals or making sure it's not thrown away a day *early* in some corner cases is important, and the simplest implementation that doesn't have horrible performance is probably good enough.","2018-04-20T02:53:08Z","2018-04-21T19:17:40Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

### Steps to reproduce


1. Create an E-Mail message


2. Enter a few letters for the recipient





### Expected behaviour


Show recipients only from the user's address book he/she has access to (if address book app is available for that user), else show no proposal for a recipient. This restriction should be configurable as an option in the config.php for sites, which offers a nextcloud service outside organisational boundaries.





### Actual behaviour


Matching names from the total user base is shown. Any user can read any E-Mail address. 





### Mail app





**Mail app version:** 0.7.10





**Mailserver or service:** dovecot / postfix





**Number of accounts:** several hundreds





### Server configuration

<!-- Please be as descriptive as possible; issues lacking the below details, or for any other reason than to report a bug, may be closed without action. -->





## Prerequisites





<!-- MARK COMPLETED ITEMS WITH AN [x] -->





- [x ] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate


- [ x] The issue still exists against the latest `master` branch of WooCommerce on Github (this is **not** the same version as on WordPress.org!)


- [ x] I have attempted to find the simplest possible steps to reproduce the issue


- [ ] I have included a failing test as a pull request (Optional)





## Steps to reproduce the issue





<!-- We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it so please be descriptive! -->





1. Use GET for orders and try to whitelist response fields like (notice attempt to whitelist nested object 'billing_address' fields): https://www.somedomain.com/wc-api/v2/orders?filter[created_at_min]=2018-04-23T08:17:11Z&filter[created_at_max]=2018-04-24T08:17:11Z&fields=id,order_number,created_at,billing_address.first_name,billing_address.last_name,billing_address.email


2. In response observe that our whitelist for nested object 'billing_address' produces only one field. Order of whitelisted fields is not important, always only last mentioned will be returned.


{""orders"":[  


      {  


         ""id"":1624,


         ""order_number"":""1624"",


         ""created_at"":""2018-04-18T09:08:46Z"",


         ""billing_address"":{  


            ""email"":""someemail@test.com""


         }


      }


]}





## Expected/actual behavior





When I follow those steps, I see that in response not all whitelisted fields are returned.





I was expecting to see that when requesting to whitelist fields in nested objects, I would get those fields.





I see that API tries to provide this functionality (https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/46d3638089b58b51a2321b67443b83f409c6b4ec/includes/api/legacy/v2/class-wc-api-resource.php#L320), but fails, because of a problem in code, when the name of the object becomes a key in array and the value is overriden as many times as there are whitelisted fields for that object and only last remains to be whitelisted.





This is important for me, as I want to be GDPR compliant. I know I could just whitelist 'billing_address' field and be done with it, but I want to collect as little data as possible to comply with consent from user, not to mention the benefit of less bandwidth.





## Isolating the problem





<!-- MARK COMPLETED ITEMS WITH AN [x] -->





- [x ] This bug happens with only WooCommerce plugin active


- [ ] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/)


- [ x] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above

This has come up in the forums and I think there's some room for improvement when it comes to making things easier for event managers.

Steps to reproduce: 
1) Set up an event and assign some people CPTs to the event, save the event.
2) Trash the event
3) Go the trashed events view in the wp admin list table
4) check the box next to the event
5) select the Delete Permanently action and click Apply

Result is you'll see some errors that say you can't delete the event. So now you have to go and restore the event from the trash, then you have to edit the event, and remove all of the relationships to things like People CPts. Then trash, then you can permanently delete.

Can we change the above so the relationships automatically get removed so all they'll have to do is trash then delete the event?","2018-04-25T03:40:48Z","2019-11-26T18:37:16Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

IP masking, anonymity sets, and no more cookies 





#### Checklist





Completed items are on `master` branch





- [x] Mask IPs with `Ahoy.mask_ips = true` (side effect: reduces geocoding accuracy)


- [x] Add `Ahoy.cookies = false` to function server-side without cookies


- [x] Add `Ahoy.configure({cookies: false})` to Ahoy.js to function client-side without cookies


- [x] Create readme instructions





#### IP Masking





Same approach as [Google Analytics IP Anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052)





- IPv4 - set last octet to 0


- IPv6 - set last 80 bits to zeros





#### Anonymity Sets & Cookies





Instead of cookies, use the following formula for visit and visitor tokens.





```


uuid_v5(""visit(or)/#{masked_ip_address}/#{user_agent}"")


```





Visitors with the same masked IP address (see above) and user agent combo will be grouped together into an [anonymity set](https://privacypatterns.org/patterns/Anonymity-set)





**Note:** Visits have an infinite duration - one approach is to add the current date/week to the hash, but this will interfere with active visits during switchover





#### Readme instructions





Update `config/initializers/ahoy.rb` to:





```ruby


class Ahoy::Store < Ahoy::DatabaseStore


  def authenticate(data)


    # do not link visits and users automatically


  end


end





Ahoy.mask_ips = true


Ahoy.cookies = false


```





If you use JavaScript tracking, set:





```js


ahoy.configure({cookies: false});


```





#### Notes





- Encryption: Should already to do this with `config.force_ssl`


- Data deletion: Data is stored in your data store, so already have full control

Simplification of wording, opt out or complete removal","> Continuation: https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby/issues/3266 Apologies for posting in the wrong repository, I did not know that `advanced metric reporting` is restricted solely to `plugin.video.emby` and is not used anywhere else in the project.





Can I request the inclusion of options that allow Emby sysadmins to control in one central location all Emby uses of advanced metric reporting, aka Google analytics or alternatively that user data logging be removed from the project completely.





I have carefully worded this request to include all Emby uses of advanced metric reporting but my primary exposure to this has been surrounding the setting in the `Emby for Kodi Sync Add-On` https://emby.media/emby-for-kodi.html





As it stands each of my users are required to navigate to `Kodi > Addons > Emby > Configure > Advanced`  and disable ""analytics metrics logging"" on each of their profiles on each of their devices. This is impractical in general and impossible given the metrics are being collected are against my children who are all too young to understand any of this.





I would also like to request this setting be altered to use clearer wording explaining what it is as in my opinion the current wording does not naturally lend itself to informing users that data is being uploaded to the cloud for analysis.





Alternatively you may find it beneficial to consider removing all user data collection as you may not be aware of recent regulation changes covering to the collection of EU citizen data by any party worldwide. These changes are far reaching and amongst other things clear up the previous grey area of data being uploaded outside of the EU by non EU parties. This FAQ should help https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.htm and I would strongly recommend Emby LLC review this and instruct their authorised partners to do so too as compliance is mandatory and it has special regulations for children you will need to follow without delay.





Note: I seriously considered not raising this ticket in fear of it becoming some flag for nay sayers to rally behind. I would ask that people do not jump on this for anything other than technical or legal compliance as *Emby LLC and their authorised partners are absolutely within their rights to collect data* they just need to do it in the right way which unfortunately in a post GDPR world is a very complex and time-consuming task.","2018-05-08T16:32:38Z","2018-05-11T23:00:05Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

This PR contains three key pieces


- Adds an abstract-ish advert consent library & tests for setting ad consents


- Adds a very barebones Scala view to set said consents


- Adds a small react view (the radio buttons) to power the aforementioned Scala view





For now, I would like a review of the advert library as the other two bits are subject to change. I can split that in its own PR if you'd like but I feel like there's a benefit in having a basic end to end example of how this all ties together.





Ah, also my react is extremely rusty so please let me know if there's anything horribly deeply wrong in there!





The actual page is hidden under a switch as the setting is not actually honoured by the ads yet





## What is the value of this and can you measure success?


We get to continue showing personalised adverts after the GDPR cutoff date





## Does this affect other platforms - Amp, Apps, etc?


No





## Does this affect GLabs Paid Content Pages? Should it have support for Paid Content?


No





## Screenshots


Look at this beauty. (Remember that design & layout & copy is still TBD at this point.)

Adding GDPR support to Smart's prebid adapter.





Please use the following test parameters:


```


          {


            code: 'div-gpt-ad-1460505748561-0',


            sizes: [[300, 250]],  // a display size


            bids: [{


              bidder: ""smart"",


              params: {


                domain: 'http://ww251.smartadserver.com',


                siteId: 207435,

              }


            }]


          }


```


As a result Smart's adapter should send acquired GDPR params in the POST message.","2018-05-14T14:41:55Z","2018-05-15T16:48:21Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

#1559





However using the dotnet-sdk-2.1.300-rc1 identity scaffolded files, when deleting a user, any saved tokens for the user that are stored in the database table ""AspNetUserTokens"" are left behind so it is not fully deleting the user and their personal data. The User Claims are correctly deleted from ""AspNetUserClaims"" table. Not sure about other related tables as i haven't got around to trying out the roles etc.





This can easily be fixed by modifying the deletion code in the scaffolded files but really needs to be correct from the start.





Another issue is that when downloading personal data, the User Claims are not downloaded from the database, these are relevant as it is personal data that is stored in the database. Obviously if you have a custom user class and have added your own fields then you will need to update the download code to include them, but there is no reason that the claims should not be downloaded by default.





Technically any stored 3rd party provider access tokens should also be included in the download as it is still personal data. I think the hashed password of the local login doesn't count as personal data with it being a hash which is irreversible.","2018-05-18T23:41:07Z","2018-05-20T16:40:41Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

In April, 2016, the European Union’s governing bodies passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a set of standards and requirements for protecting the privacy and personal information of EU residents.

As the new GDPR rules come into play May 25th we need to offer tools to delete all data existing on a customer if requested. It was proposed to do this as an open source package and this PR is intended to provide just those tools.





#### Description





Me and @cneijenhuis worked together to put this together the other day real quick. It is not yet finished but I would love to get your feedback on it so far. Since I am on vacation the rest of this week it would help a lot in order to wrap it up quickly.

  - Site Verification


  - Sitemaps


  - Spam Filtering


  - Lazy Images / Photon


  - SSO


  - Subscriptions


  - Infinite Scroll

### Notes





- For iOS, the `extras` have already been exposed on the `AdView` instance and can conform to GDPR by including the `npa` key. Example:


```js


var adView = AdMob.createAdView({


  // -- Other parameters here --


  extras: {


    'npa': '1' // Disable personalized ads


  }


});


```


- For Android, `extras` should be passed to `requestAd`. Example:


```js


AdMob.requestAd({


  extras: {


    'npa': '1' // Disable personalized ads


  }


});


```

1. Provoz hostingu lišty platím ze své kapsy a není to levná sranda (viz #12),


2. v návaznosti na GDPR vydalo ÚOOÚ nové stanovisko (viz dále).





Lištu klidně používejte dál, pokud je pro Vás důležitá, jen si ji musíte zkopírovat na svůj web (viz níže).





## Podrobnosti


Úřad pro ochranu osobních údajů [ve svém včerejším doporučení](https://www.uoou.cz/cookies-a-nbsp-gdpr/d-29966) představil nové pojetí pohledu na Cookies ve vztahu k ochraně osobních údajů, ze kterého vyplývá, že tato lišta již není potřeba pro drtivou většinu jejích reálných implementací.





Po dobu provozu jsem různými způsoby monitoroval, jakým způsobem je lišta používána – pouze jeden web použil pokročilé možnosti lišty, kterými skutečně podmínil sbírání údajů o uživatelích. Všechny ostatní implementace považuju nyní za nadbytečné a postrádající smysl, protože neplní žádnou užitečnou funkci, ani zákonné nařízení a pouze obtěžují uživatele.





Další informace na serveru e-legal: [Úřad pro ochranu osobních údajů prolomil mlčení ohledně cookies](http://www.e-legal.cz/clanky/urad-pro-ochranu-osobnich-udaju-prolomil-mlceni-ohledne-cookies)





Z tohoto důvodu jsem se rozhodl ukončit existenci této lišty. Lišta nyní bude zobrazovat upozornění a ke dni 1. 9. 2018 bude z hostingu odstraněna.





### Harmonogram ukončení


- [x] Od 23. 5. 2018: jemné upozornění (#15) s odkazem na tuto issue


- [x] Od 1. 6. 2018: viditelnější upozornění (#16 - změna ikonky na výrazně červenou + varování přes [`console.warn()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/warn))


- [x] Od 1. 7. 2018: logování varování pomocí [`console.error()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/error) (#17)


- [x] Od 1. 9. 2018: vypnutí lišty – místo zobrazení bude kód logovat chybu přes [`console.error()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/error) a současně vyhodí [`throw Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) (#18)


- [x] Od 1. 1. 2019: vypnutí CDN a změna S3 bucketu na privátní (bude vracet chybu 403).





## Stažení původní funkční lišty


Pokud však z nějakého důvodu trváte na použití této lišty, stahněte si lištu ze [stránky poslední funkční verze lišty](https://github.com/jakubboucek/fucking-eu-cookies/releases/latest). Případně můžete využít neoficiální fork na CDN (nejsem autorem): https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eu-cookie-law

It's not consistent across the board, but here is an example from moniker.com: https://faq.moniker.com/my-account/european-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr





Currently aws-web-stacks tells AWS to validate the requested domain using 'email validation'. AWS sends the email an email to 5 specified accounts at the domain in question (like 'admin', 'webmaster', etc) and then also to the 3 emails listed as the Registrant, Technical, and Administrative contact in WHOIS. Those last 3 will no longer be available if the registrar is now hiding them. If you happen to have mail set up for the domain, then you're OK because one of the first 5 accounts should receive the email.





If not, however, the email will never get to you, cert approval will fail, and the stack will get rolled back. For subdomains like foo.example.com, you're probably not going to want to set up a MX record for each subdomain.

A feature currently required by the Cookie Law and GDPR is to be able to list and display cookies inside of the the _Privacy Policy page_. 





You are currently able to do this in the Consent Banner Modal, would there be a way to ""embed"" the same information into a post in any way, using a script? 





If not that would be a great feature that consent manager solutions are offering (and currently require me to use both segment + another cookie solution at the same time on my sites).

### URL(s) where the issue occurs





Any wapo url apart from the homepage, e.g. `https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-fires-back-at-us-tariffs-vows-to-defend-its-core-interests/2018/07/06/f42fc812-8091-11e8-a63f-7b5d2aba7ac5_story.html`, after you've viewed 5 pages.





### Describe the issue





A paywall box appears on the screen, and the URL in the address bar is changed to the homepage. Zapping the element doesn't work, as the article has been truncated. If you hit ESC at the right time (just before the address changes), you can stop the paywall activating without having to use an incognito window.





### Screenshot(s)





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/285430/42380957-88359128-8127-11e8-8367-467a4be36df5.png)





### Versions





- Browser/version:





Google Chrome | 67.0.3396.99 (Official Build) (64-bit) (cohort: Stable)


-- | --


Revision | a337fbf3c2ab8ebc6b64b0bfdce73a20e2e2252b-refs/branch-heads/3396@{#790}





- uBlock Origin version: Nano Adblocker 1.0.0.55, Nano Defender 15.0.0.5





### Settings





- None





### Notes





Using an incognito window is annoying because you have to go through the GDPR warning again, and it only lasts for 5 pages before you need to close the window and start again. Hitting ESC before the address changes will stop the paywall and allow you to read the article, but the timing is very tight and comments can't be read on the article. I wonder if it's possible to have the paywall script stopped as a matter of course in Nano Defender? Thanks.





EDIT: I found this: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/38567-washington-post-paywall-bypass - it works as a temporary stopgap but it means I need TamperMonkey running. I guess I'm hoping for this to be implemented in Nano directly so I don't need to also have TamperMonkey for one script.","2018-07-06T13:22:18Z","2018-07-06T15:42:44Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

https://www.kunena.org/forum/general-questions-and-how-tos/153355-social-share-buttons





**To Reproduce**


Steps to reproduce the behavior:


1. Choose in the template setting Display Social Share = Yes


2. Visit your Forum as guest





**Expected behavior**


Social Share should be available





**Actual result**


Guests can't see the buttons





**Additional context**


But when we make Social Share available to guests, then makes the profile setting ""Social Share - Yes or No"" no sense.


As soon as a member log out, the Social Share buttons are back, also if in their profile is set ""Social Share - No"".


My opinion, it is the task of the website operator to inform his users about privacy (GDPR)  and to define if there are Social Share on his website or not.

Is it possible that there's a persisting bug in v2.6? Thank you for looking into it.

A site that uses Google Analytics is configured using tarteaucitron. A visitor comes to the site and does not activate the third party services by scrolling past a certain point or clicking OK - they signal their acceptance by navigating to another page on the site.





The problems with this:





1) The visit metric for the first page is lost along with any referrer information because Google Analytics is only loaded by the time they get to their second page of browsing the site.


2) Referrer information is lost as when Google Analytics is loaded it will appear that the referrer is the first page that the user visited.





Per Recital 32 of the GDPR:


""...Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as ... conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject’s acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data.""





I would like to explore peoples thoughts around the idea of initialising the services (or at least those that you deem important for your purposes on first page load), once a user clicks a link to navigate (i.e. has given their consent), is it worth providing a configurable option that slightly delays the navigation to the next page to give the opportunity for some services to load and do their reporting (e.g. Google Analytics reporting the entry page visit and maintaining referrer information).





I'd like to hear opinions on whether this is feasible or a feature that people would like?","2018-08-22T16:58:05Z","2021-03-10T01:11:27Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

Please describe.**


In the event's page there are 10 names displayed at participants. Sone concers related to this


- This doesn't feel very private for me. I do not remember having a notice while registering telling me that my name will be displayed online. 


- Some names are just one letter or so - not feeling the participation as a real one


- there are 10 displayed on 3 columns - on desktop there will be one on the 4th line alone, on mobile it is in the middle.  9 (3x) would be better


* The list is written in very small text, aligned to left when all the page is middle'd





**Describe the solution you'd like**


* Solution 1:


  * Hide participants


* Solution 2:


  * If we decide to keep it add 


  * 1) A tick option to inform people you will add their names - they can opt out.    


  * 2) Add the last 9 ones ( 3 X 3 ) 





**Describe alternatives you've considered**


Any of the Solutions would work in a way





**Additional context**


* Under EU law we need to consider GDPR 


* We - at Mozilla - value privacy, I really feel we missed this part here.

Tanken her er at betydningen av `legal_documents.json` har endret seg fra å være hovedkilden til hvilke lover vi lister på Juridika (https://juridika.no/kommentarer), til at dette nå hentes fra database og `legal_documents.json` nå brukes kun for å overskrive _tittelen_ på disse lovene, der hvor de skal listes med en annen tittel på forsiden enn på selve loven.

I've been working with my colleague Dennis on some new features of our awesome ""Umbraco Forms on Steroids""-package to make it more GDPR-compliant. We have been working to realize some important parts of my blogpost and HTML mockup (https://skrift.io/articles/archive/i-have-a-nightmare-dream-about-umbraco-and-gdpr/, http://downloads.perplex.eu/umbraco/gdpr/settings2.html). 





Specifically we've been working on ""delete data after x period"" and encryption of the data.





The ""delete data after x period"" is already fixed with a workflow, and we will also do the encryption with a workflow. But when retrieving the data in the backoffice we have a problem and hopefully you can take a look shortly, so we can fix this and release the new and improved package. 





We hoped that we could decrypt the data when plugging into the event 





RecordStorage.RecordFetching += RecordStorage_RecordFetching;





So if we clicked on ""Entries"" in the backoffice forms-section this would get called and we could decrypt every record. But this isn't triggered and if we sneakpeek into the dll we see that the functions GetAllRecords and GetRecords in RecordStorage.cs do not dispatch this event (it does in GetRecord and GetRecordByUniqueID), and that is why we can't decrypt data.





Could you think for just a moment how we could achieve the decryption in the backoffice without rewriting whole parts of the work you've done?





=== 


Submitted a Ticket to ZenDesk and Dennis asked me to add this to the issue:





The change is fairly simple as it just involves dispatching the event in those two methods of RecordStorage.cs (you can leave a note for whoever picks up the issue that it's line 76 and 132).





I'd however like that someone with Forms knowledge verifies that this approach is okay and that we do not cause any performance issues by triggering this as separate single events for each record, instead of batching it up with a new event type.





I don't think there will be any major issues though, as we also currently fetch the data for every single record through a foreach loop but would just like to be sure ;)





=== 


Hopefully this can be fixed soon!

> A Mastodon account can be disabled. This prevents the user from doing anything with the account, but all of the content is still there untouched. This limitation is reversible, the account can be re-enabled at any time. This limitation is only available for local users on your server.





https://docs.joinmastodon.org/usage/moderation/#disable-login





And it's all sorts of wrong:





1. When this suspension is applied to the user they cannot log out. 


They will see 403 unless they clear session cookies manually.  


2. If user manages to log back in they will be stuck in 403 again, untill sessions cookies are cleared manually.  


3. There's no indication what's going on.


4. User is not able to delete or export their data or access any other settings such as redirect account etc.

I've also updated the minimum version of Moodle the plugin will work with, as the privacy implementation uses PHP 7 style type hinting. We can also use the legacy polyfil if required, but it is better to be moving forward.





I added the null provider privacy class to the plugin. This means that the plugin doesn't store user information. This was a tough call. From my understanding of the plugin, even though the plugin is very flexible it won't store user data. As plugin configuration generally doesn't either. The settings defined in this plugin may cause the plugin it is extending to store data, but this is the responsibility of that plugin.

Need image that does not have code script embedded in it.  As image is not owned by Ketch we cannot manipulate it, must ask source to provide image that doesn't have site data collection in it.  Instead we can provide a link in the image to Robert's site of choice.   However we cannot have script code in images as we cannot serve that without legal declaration and asking user for approval to send information to third party (which is a killer to do on web).

    SO - any comments on the proposal from ED. 


    DW- the current tests relate to WIS1.  The question is whether the test result publication is a validation of WIS1 compliance.


    SO - This is intended to a measure of quality and how test automation.


    JA  - Is this for all projects, rather than just WIS1.


    SO -Yes.


    DW - Yes this could be used beyond WIS1, a generic approach. Suggested that we look at other projects and feedback.


    WQ - We have some automated testing in the CI process. But not clear how it fits with WIS1 e


    DW - I don’t we should be specific to WIS1 as this is the only criteria we have now and the Association will consider other projects. A generic statement would be good.


    SO - It would be good if its applies to WIS1 and can evolve


    DW - It would be good to keep this one and see what applies to WIS2 when more information on WIS2 is available.


    WQ - Keep WIS1 is maintenance mode. So should not be concerned with test metrics and review if there is a major issue.  The next round of GIS audits are being worked on but no detail yet.

## Description


We are using the tool Codified Security to find out the security issues in the signed apk and we are getting the following security issues:





**1. App creates a temp file :**


You need to fix this because:





Sensitive data might be written into a temp file.


You can fix this by changing this in your code.





Avoid creating temp files.


Common Weakness Enumeration





CWE-295 — The software does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a


certificate.





Problem has been found in:


com/facebook/cache/disk/DefaultDiskStorage.java


`try {


paramString = new InserterImpl(paramString, paramObject.createTempFile(localFile));


        return paramString;


      localStringBuilder.append(resourceId); localStringBuilder.append(""."");


return File.createTempFile(localStringBuilder.toString(),


   "".tmp"", paramFile);


      }`





com/facebook/react/modules/camera/ImageEditingManager.java





`paramContext = localFile;


      }


   return File.createTempFile(""ReactNative_cropped_image_"",


 getFileExtensionForType(paramString), paramContext);


  }


            if ((localObject != null) && (!


((String)localObject).isEmpty()))


            {


              File localFile = ImageEditingManager.createTempFile(mContext, (String)localObject);


ImageEditingManager.writeCompressedBitmapToFile(paramVarArgs,


(String)localObject, localFile);


 `


com/google/android/gms/common/data/BitmapTeleporter.java


`try {


  localFile = File.createTempFile(""teleporter"", "".tmp"", zali);


}`





**2. TCP socket usage detected**





**You need to fix this because:**


TCP sockets need to be encrypted otherwise it may be vulnerable to the following attack mechanisms: DoS attacks, replay attacks, man in the middle (MITM) attacks, eavesdropping and subsequent impersonation. It's highly recommended to use TLS or other methods to secure your connection.


 **Common Weakness Enumeration**


CWE-941 — The software creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.


More information can be seen on the CWE website 


**# PCI compliance.**


This app may be in breach of PCI-DSS 2.2.3, 2.3 and 4.1.


SSL and early TLS (versions lower than 1.2) are not considered strong cryptography.


**HIPAA compliance.**


Transmission Security


This app may be in breach of HIPAA encryption requirements.


SSL and early TLS (versions lower than 1.2) are not considered strong cryptography.


**GDPR compliance.**


This app may be in breach of GDPR encryption requirements.


SSL and early TLS (versions lower than 1.2) are not considered strong cryptography.


**OWASP compliance.**


OWASP M3: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection


This app may be in breach of OWASP encryption requirements.

## 連絡した背景





サイボウズのフロントエンドの基盤作りを一緒に行って頂きたいと考え、ご連絡させて頂きました。


サイボウズでは、各プロダクトの開発を行うエンジニアはサーバーサイドとフロントエンドのどちらも担当します。


これは、サーバーサイドからフロントエンドを含めて最適化した設計ができることや、サーバーサイドからフロントエンドまで一気通貫したプロダクトに対する理解が深まるといったメリットがあります。


また、各エンジニアがサーバーサイドエンジニアとフロントエンドエンジニアのどちらも担当できるため、柔軟なチーム構成を可能にします。





その一方、フロントエンドにおけるさらなる探求については各メンバーの自発的な活動によって行われていました。


JSer.infoを使ったフロントエンドランチもその一貫です。





加えてサイボウズの場合は、kintoneをはじめカスタマイズやプラグインといった形により、kintoneの上でHTML/CSS/JSを使って開発するプラットフォームとしての役割もあります。


したがって、プラットフォームとして開発者に対するライブラリやツールの提供といった役割もあります。





* Developer Networkのサイト


    * https://developer.cybozu.io/hc/ja


* kintoneのGitHubリポジトリ


    * https://github.com/kintone





これらの活動については、下記の資料にて紹介しています。





* 100人100通りのフロントエンド


    * https://speakerdeck.com/koba04/100ren-100tong-rifalsehurontoendo





2017年10月にフロントエンドを専門的に行うフロントエンドエキスパートチームが誕生し、フロントエンドに対する探求をプロダクトチームと一緒に行うことや、勉強会などの開催による情報共有や教育、研究開発を行うための役割が正式に誕生しました。





これらの活動は、azuさんの下記の思いに近いのではないかと思い、今回連絡させて頂きました。





> また、自分自身が特定のドメインに詳しくなり単一障害点となることよりも、 特定のドメインに取り組んでいる人を支援して課題を解決する手伝いをしたいという思いがあります。





フロントエンドエキスパートチームについても、まだまだ試行錯誤している段階です。


これまでにazuさんが行われていたような会社全体のフロントエンドを改善する活動の経験をもとに、是非一緒にサイボウズ全体のフロントエンドを改善していきたいと思っています。





## 事業、市場、規模





サイボウズは「チームワークあふれる社会を創る」という理念に沿って、チームワークを支えるソフトウェアを開発している会社です。





https://cybozu.co.jp/

* [サイボウズLive](https://live.cybozu.co.jp/) ... 無料チャット・無料グループウェア (2019年4月終了予定)





を提供しています。


これ以外にも、上記のサービスを提供するのに必要なシステムが存在します。





当初はパッケージ製品として提供していましたが、2011年からはクラウドサービス「cybozu.com」の提供を開始しており、


現在ではクラウドサービスによる売上がパッケージ製品の売上を上回っています。


規模感としては、契約社数が27,000社以上、契約ユーザーライセンスは140万人以上となります。





社員数は約800名で、国内以外にも中国、ベトナム、米国に拠点があります。


売上も2016年が約80億円、2017年が約95億円、2018年は第3四半期の時点で約82億円(前年同期比20%増)と、


パッケージ製品の安定した売上とクラウド製品の伸びにより、成長を続けています。





国内では、kintoneの利用企業数が10,000社突破、サイボウズOfficeは60,000社突破、Garoonは4,800社突破など確固たる地位を確立しています。


海外では、中国、東南アジア、米国においてサービスを展開しており、米国ではkintoneはリブランディングした形でサービスを展開しています。





https://www.kintone.com/





現在は米国市場をさらに拡大すべく、開発基盤をcybozu.comからは切り離してAWS上で提供するための開発を行なっております。

## デザイン





サイボウズにはデザイングループがあり、プロダクトチームの一員として活動しています。


デザイングループについては、下記を参照ください。





* https://cybozu.co.jp/company/job/recruitment/designgroup/





社内にユーザーテストのための環境があるため、頻繁にユーザーテストを行いながら改善を続けています。


また、サイボウズの社員はサイボウズ製品を使って業務を行なっているため、すぐにフィードバックを受けることが可能です。





また最近では、モバイルページのリニューアルに取り組んでおり、


エンジニアとデザイナーが一緒にモブプログラミングを行いながらデザインを作りあげています。

## チーム





サイボウズでは、製品に対して、開発のプロダクトマネージャーとビジネス側のプロダクトマネージャーがいて、


開発PMは製品に対しての方向性や戦略を決定し、ビジネス側のPMは販売戦略を決定します。





* 「世の中に価値を届けよう！」サイボウズのプロダクトマネジメントについて


    * https://blog.cybozu.io/entry/product-manager





また、開発では、エンジニアやデザイナー以外にも、QAやSRE、TC(Technical Communication)、PSIRTなど多くのメンバーが関わっています。


現在では多くのチームがスクラムを採用しています。

    * https://www.slideshare.net/ama-ch/ss-86003462





エンジニアやデザイナー、QAなどクロスファンクショナルなプロダクトチームとは別に、専門性を持ってプロダクトチームを支援するチームが存在します。


フロントエンドエキスパートチームもその1つです。


その1つである生産性向上チームと支援チームの役割については下記のスライドを参照ください。





* 組織横断でエンジニアを支援する生産性向上チームの役割


    * https://www.slideshare.net/miyajan/ss-83175725





また、サイボウズ・ラボという組織もあり、より長期の視点で研究開発を行ったり、OSS開発、標準化活動、教育活動などに注力することも可能です。





* サイボウズ・ラボ

## テクノロジー





kintoneはクラウド型のデータベースを提供するサービスで、業務アプリケーションを簡単に作成できます。


開発の知識がなくてもドラッグアンドドロップなどの直感的なUIで簡単に業務アプリケーションを作成できるため、業務を改善したいと思った時にこれまでは開発会社やエンジニアに頼むしかなかったことも、自分たちでkintoneのアプリケーションを作成することで実現できるようになります。





kintoneを使った業務改善のストーリーを発表するkintone hiveというイベントも行われています。

kintoneを支えるテクノロジーとして、柔軟でスケーラブルな仮想データベースを実現するサーバーサイドアプリケーションやインフラの技術と、誰もが簡単にアプリケーションを作成出来るようにするためのフロントエンドの技術が重要な要素となります。





フロントエンドについては、大規模な開発に対応するためサイボウズでは静的型付けなどの技術に早くから取り組んできました。


また、前述した通り、kintoneはHTML/CSS/JSなどフロントエンドの技術を用いたプラグインやカスタマイズという形で拡張が可能です。


このエコシステムをさらに広げていくためのDX(Developer Experience)を提供するための開発や情報提供も行なっています。


モバイル上でカスタマイズのあるべき姿などは今後検討すべき課題の1つです。





また、これらを実現するための基礎として、CI/CDや自動テスト基盤による品質向上やリリースの高速化といった取り組みにも力を入れています。





取り組んでいる技術については、エンジニアブログで公開しているのでそちらもご参照ください。

## 透明性





開発のメンバーだけではなく、全ての社員がkintoneやGaroon上で仕事をしているので、全ての情報が集約されています。


エンジニアに限らず、全社員がオンラインコミュニケーションツールを使いこなしていることは、サイボウズの大きな特徴の1つです。


kintone上でいわゆる分報をつぶやいている社員も多く、そこをきっかけに部署や役職を横断して議論が起きることもよくあります。





また、社内の情報はできるだけオープンに公開されています。


例えば経営会議の議事録と資料が全社員に公開されているので、誰がどのような発言をしたのかということも知ることができます。





社外においても、社内の制度などはサイボウズ式などのメディアで積極的に公開されています。





https://cybozushiki.cybozu.co.jp/





また、最近はOSSポリシーを策定して外部に公開しました。


その際、頂いた意見に対しての見解も公開しています。

## 課題





パッケージ製品からクラウド製品に移行していく中で、開発のスタイルやインフラのあり方もクラウドにあった形に変えていくのが今の大きな課題です。


アーキテクチャ、開発・運用のプロセスや体制、CI/CDなどリリースフローなどを見直し、ユーザーに対してより高い価値をよりスピーディに提供していくことを目指しています。


kintone.comをAWS化する「Yakumo」プロジェクトや、インフラのアーキテクチャ刷新を行う「Neco」プロジェクトなどはそれを解決するための取り組みの一部です。


Necoの成果物はGitHub上で公開されています。

またプロダクトが巨大になるにつれて、属人性が増えてしまう部分があるため、多くのチームでモブプログラミングなどを通じて知識の共有が行われています。





フロントエンドに関して言えば、素早い改善とリリースを可能にするためのリファクタリングが課題としてあります。


その一環としてビューとドメインをしっかり分離する取り組みが行われており、kintoneではReactやFluxが取り入れられています。


またコードの規模が大きいため、Lint系のツールの導入やリファクタリングの際にもcodemodを使ったアプローチが採用されています。


プロダクトが巨大になるとコアとなる部分に手を入れるのが難しくなるため、今後は如何にドメインを分割するかといったことも課題になってくると考えています。





kintoneが提供しているプラグインシステムにおいても、改善を進めていますがまだまだ不足している部分が多く、


npmフレンドリーな開発者に対しても、そうでない開発者に対しても更なるDXの向上が課題としてあります。


また、ブラウザ上で動作するサードパーティ製のプラグインをよりセキュアで互いの干渉がない形で提供する、という点も今後の課題です。


これはECMAScriptの言語仕様やセキュリティ関連のWeb APIの策定動向を見守りながら検討していきたいと思っています。





モバイルについては、以前はあまり注力していませんでしたが、現在はモバイルチームもできてフォーカスして開発に取り組んでいる分野です。


Webとネイティブの使い分け、カスタマイズの提供方法、パフォーマンス、PWA関連技術など、より良いモバイルUXを提供するために今後取り組んでいきます。





また、ヘルプなどの文章を作成するテクニカルコミュニケーショングループでは、文章の校正にtextlintを利用したりコンテンツの配信にNetlifyを利用することで、


校正の自動化やリリースの高速化に取り組んでいます。





## 裁量





具体的な仕組みと言われると難しいですが、サイボウズは「チームワークあふれる社会を創る」という理念のもとに集まっているチームであり、それを実現するために必要なことであれば実現できる環境です。





サイボウズでは、どのような働き方がしたいのかやどれくらい給与が欲しいのかなども含めて、自分がどうしたいのかを表現する必要があります。


このように何が希望がある場合は、それを表現することが当たり前な風土があります。





* 初公開！サイボウズの自由すぎる働き方はこんなやり方で管理されていた

* ここまで見せていいの？ーサイボウズの「給与評価」と「キャリアパス」の裏側を、人事が赤裸々に語る


    * https://cybozu.co.jp/sp/workstyle/workstyle24.html





kintoneにはピープルという個人のタイムラインのようなものがあり、ここで気軽に発言することで新しい動きのきっかけになることもあります。





また、サイボウズでは、説明責任と質問責任があります。


質問責任とある通り、何か疑問に思うことがあれば質問して議論を行う必要があります。


そのため、議論が発生することもありますが、職場は多様な人が集まっているという前提があるため異なる意見も受け入れられる風土があると思います。

## プライバシー





GDPR対応については、現在は社外にアナウンスするため準備している状態であるため、ここでの回答は差し控えさせていただきます。





## リモートワーク





サイボウズでは、ツール、制度、風土の3点でアプローチしています。





* ツール


    * グループウェア


    * テレビ会議システム


    * 在宅勤務用PC


    * 外部アクセス


* 制度


    * 100人100通りの働き方


    * ウルトラワーク


* 風土


    * 多様性


    * 複数拠点をまたいだチーム





サイボウズでは、リモートワークは「特別」な状態ではないため、スムーズに行うことができると思います。


勉強会なども多くの場合は、他拠点だけでなく自宅から参加、登壇も珍しくありません。


これを実現するために、制度やツールの整備を積極的に行なっています。

This issue relates to the page:


""<url>/civicrm/gdpr/comms-prefs/update""





## Expected Behaviour


- Updating ""Email"" / ""Post"" should reflect the values set on the Contact in CiviCRM (either ""Yes"" or ""No"")





## Current Behaviour


- The select input boxes for ""Email"" and ""Post"" always default to ""Yes""





## Steps to Reproduce


I believe this is a User Interface bug on the URL this issue relates to. There are additional screenshots below.


1. Visit ""<url>/civicrm/gdpr/comms-prefs/update""


2. Update ""Email"" and/or ""Post"" to ""No""


3. Save


4. ""Email"" and ""Post"" will be set to ""No""


5. Refresh this page (just go to the URL bar and click enter, refreshing will resubmit this form/keep the state of the select input boxes)


6. ""Email"" and ""Post"" will now be displayed as ""Yes"", however the Contact in CiviCRM will have:


    - ""DO NOT MAIL""


    - ""NO BULK EMAILS (USER OPT OUT)""





### Screenshots


1. How it looks when I visit ""<url>/civicrm/gdpr/comms-prefs/update"":

`vault_batch_encrypt` and `vault_batch_decrypt` work correctly when some of the values are present, but not if the array contains only blank values.





If all the values are blank, we send an empty array to Vault, which returns ```missing batch input to process```


Solution is not to do any calls, when all values are blank and simply return them as they are.

- Implements initial version of Registration, Signup, AddToCart and Purchase events handling functions by exporting them directly from the `analytics` object and removing the requirement to resort to including `ad-tracking` all over Calypso.


- Attempts to make the above as coherent as possible across Google Analytics, Google Ads (via Gtag), Facebook, Bing.


- Removed Donuts tracking.





This PR focuses on having the main networks above connected to the ""Signup"" and ""Purchase"" events. In subsequent PRs we'll complete the coverage of all events across all the main and secondary networks.





**Testing Setup**





- Make sure you have the following features enabled in:


  - `development.json`: `gdpr-banner`, `google-analytics`, `ad-tracking` 


  - or via the URL params in the calypso.live URL: https://calypso.live/?branch=add/google-ads-gtag-cleanup (`?flags=gdpr-banner,google-analytics,ad-tracking`)





- Enable debug logs by entering the following in your browser console:


```


localStorage.setItem( 'debug', 'calypso:analytics:*' );


```


- Set the following to ensure the GDPR logic does not block the trackers:


```


document.cookie = 'sensitive_pixel_option=yes;'


```





- Reload Calypso and make sure you see `isAdTrackingAllowed: true` through out the test in the JS console.





- Make sure to select the options ""Preserve Logs"" in both Chrome's JS console and Network tab.





**Testing ""Registration"" and ""Signup"" Events**





- Point your Calypso to `/start/user`


- Create a new WordPress.com testing account


- In Chrome's Network tab filter by `calypso_user_registration_complete`: you should see two entries, one for Tracks (`pixel.wp.com`) and one for Google Analytics (`google-analytics.com`).


- Note: at the moment there are no marketing trackers bound to this event yet, ie, no Facebook, Google Ads etc.





- Select a free domain


- Select a paid plan 


- Filter the Network tab by the following to inspect we fired the Signup event on every network:


  - `calypso_signup_complete` --> Tracks (`http://pixel.wp.com/t.gif[...]` entry)


  - `calypso_signup_complete` --> Google Analytics (www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Signup&ea=calypso_signup_complete:is_new_user,is_new_site,has_cart_items[...])


  - `zKK-CKPG7ocBENbl8_wD` --> AdWords


  - `5-NnCKy3xZQBEP6YlcMD` --> Google Ads Gtag


  - `ec=signup` --> Bing (`bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=4074038[...]`)


  - `ev=Subscribe&` --> Facebook


  - `signu1` --> Floodlight (`6355556.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;dc_pre=CKKP9aW-rOACFUzD3god3OACkA;type=wordp0;cat=signu1;ord=1;[...]`)


- By this point you should have been redirected to a log-in page and received an email to activate your account.


- You can activate your email copying the link in the incognito window that you used to launch your Calypso instance.


- Once verified head to `/log-in` and enter the newly created account credentials.


- Double check that so far there are no suspect JS errors.


- You should have the previously selected plan in your cart.





**Testing ""AddToCart"" Events**





- Add a paid plan to the cart for a test site without finalizing the payment.


- Filter by the following in Chrome's Network tab to check we fire the event on the various networks:


  - `calypso_cart_product_add` --> Tracks (`pixel.wp.com/t.gif?[...]_en=calypso_cart_product_add[...]`)


  - `calypso_cart_product_add` --> Google Analytics (`www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Checkout&ea=calypso_cart_product_add[...]`)


  - `AddToCart` --> Facebook (`www.facebook.com/tr/?id=823166884443641&ev=AddToCart&[...]`)





**Testing ""Purchase"" Events**





- Finalize the purchase of the plan using free credits


- Filter by the following in Chrome's Network tab to check we fire the event on the various networks:


  - `calypso_checkout_payment_success` --> Tracks (`pixel.wp.com/t.gif?[...]_en=calypso_checkout_payment_success[...]`)


  - `calypso_checkout_payment_success` --> Google Analytics (`www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Purchase&ea=calypso_checkout_payment_success[...]`)


  - `taG8CPW8spQBEP6YlcMD` --> Google Ads Gtag


  - `type=wpsal0;cat=purch0` --> Floodlight WPCom (`6355556.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;dc_pre=CKbTs9zwrOACFUe0UQodDtQNZQ;type=wpsal0;cat=purch0[...]`)


  - `type=wpsal0;cat=wpsale` --> Floodlight Legacy (`6355556.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;dc_pre=CKbTs9zwrOACFUe0UQodDtQNZQ;type=wpsal0;cat=wpsale[...]`)


  - `ev=Purchase` -> Facebook (`www.facebook.com/tr/?id=823166884443641&ev=Purchase&[...]`)


  - `app_id=653793` --> Nanigans (`api.nanigans.com/event.php[...]`)


  - `ec=purchase` --> Bing (`bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=4074038[...]`)


  - `tags.w55c.net/rs?id=d299eef42f2d4135a96d0d40ace66f3a&t=checkout` --> Icon Media


  - `_fp.event.Purchase` --> Quantcast (`pixel.quantserve.com/pixel;[...]labels=_fp.event.Purchase%20Confirmation%2C_fp.pcat.[...]`)





**Test Free Signups**


- Create a new test account this time by choosing both a free domain and a free plan.


- Once created your Network tab should show the following entry for Google Analytics:


  - Filter by: `calypso_signup_complete:is_new_user,is_new_site` --> `https://www.google-analytics.com/collect?[...]ec=Signup&ea=calypso_signup_complete%3Ais_new_user%2Cis_new_site[...]`


- Note there is no `has_cart_items` in the event.","2018-12-07T19:34:09Z","2019-02-11T18:09:53Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

Seems like legally the safest thing to do is always forbid cookies until user explicitly opts into them, even for anonymized-ip, no-data-sharing Google Analytics.

Realistically, I knew from the outset that I would never really need a Privacy Policy and a Cookie Policy and strict adherence to EU Cookie Law for a small portfolio site. But I enjoyed the exercise.

### What This Does





To be compliant with GDPR and cookie laws, we have the following changes:





* Signup now requires explicit consent to the code of conduct, ToS, and privacy policy.


    * Privacy policy will require a section on cookie usage to be fully compliant


    * Code of conduct isn't a legal requirement, but seemed like a good idea to highlight during signup


    * If the ZF team wants to use user emails for anything other than the grants site, we'll need to add another checkbox asking for explicit consent to do that.


* Adds the ability to delete users in the admin


    * Unlike other forms of delete which would just flip a status to `DELETED`, this will actually purge the system of the account


    * We may need to figure out some kind of db backup purging for #143, or exclude users from backups.


* Removes the unused `redux-persist` since we switch to cookie-based auth


    * Since user is only given cookies at signup, this removes the need for a notification due to having to agree to privacy policy. If there's ever a need for pre-auth local storage or cookies, we'll need to add a notification on visit.





### Steps to Test





* Sign up as a new user, confirm that you cannot signup without agreeing to legal stuff


* Confirm sign in / sign out persistence still works as expected


* Confirm you can delete the user in the admin, and that it completely removes them","2019-02-04T21:29:52Z","2019-02-05T15:43:22Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

We now have to obey the law and comply with GDPR, ensuring people's data are securely stored, we track who has access to it and if the client requests to review, update or remove their data, we should do so in an automated fashion. But, are you there yet? Chances are, there's still a long way to go.





In this talk I will address some of the challenges we solved in greenfield projects as well in old, legacy applications. We introduced ""privacy by design"" as just another ""by design"" mantra we already had build in our workflow and as we worked on the project, we applied it everywhere when we saw user data (personal or not) was processed. This ensured that all data was handled and treated the same way and allowed the business to reorient themselves again to be creative in approaching their customers.

A strange error indeed, but have tested it on two separate servers. I just can't access the asset files. For example ""plugins/offline/gdpr/assets/images/cookie-setup.jpg"" and ""plugins/offline/gdpr/assets/cookieBanner/banner.css"". I can access asset files in other plugins but not in this. For example ""plugins/flynsarmy/sociallogin/assets/marketplace/icon.png"" works just fine.





I just get a 404 error, and I can't seem to find out where the problem lies. If i try to access plugins via ""plugins/"" all plugins with a assets folder responds with a 403, but the plugins without an assets responds with a 404. But this plugin contains an asset folder. But still i get the 404 response.





Anyone else experienced this?

I noticed that with GDPR checkboxes I am able to use this in template

      <span class='second-icon fa fa-check-square fa-base'></span>

       "".LANCONTACT_21.""</label>


			<div class='help-block'>{CONTACT_GDPR_LINK}</div>

but not with login Remember me shortcode.  I had to set it manually





```


        <label class=""checkbox display-checkbox"" for=""autologin-1"">

        </label>


```





The reason is that GDPR works with array and login checkbox with string and then it always insert html markup for label. 


`


return e107::getForm()->checkbox('gdpr', 1,false, $parm);


`





`return e107::getForm()->checkbox('autologin',1,false, LAN_LOGIN_8);`

I just registered on a corp page BEFORE i left my current corp, what means, all corp an alliance mails went to the ""new corp"". Ok, it's from the mechanic, i agree. But, since GDPR is a big point of view, i generally MISS the option to delete all my data from the server. 


Furthermore, the registration process does not inform me about data handling, who will be responsible in person for my data, who can view it, store it, alter it, or delete is.





Its a MAJOR issue.





I don't know if development is still ongoing or not, but the software in use, so this could be a responsibility question.

I suggest that we require direct opt-in or written consent (by for example email), as lists like this one are often used for targeted harassment and we generally want to encourage a consent-first practice. 





I'm one of the directors on the .NET Foundation board of directors and involved with the outreach and diversity action group, and we would love to be able to recommend this site as a place to find female mentors, speakers and more- but we also want to be careful with recommending lists where the people on the list have not opted in or consented to be added.





I understand that it can be difficult to gather consent after the fact (but it is doable), but maybe at least we can start by requiring that a new person has consented or opted-in.





This would also help following the GDPR and similar directives and laws regarding data collection, privacy and managing data to avoid future issues and encourage good practices.

Firstly, thanks for developing this. Tool works like a charm.


However, I found an issue with Azure blob storage.





The default name for a backup file is something like this:


""/storage/daily/daily-1561690800.gz""





However, as I found out from Azure tech support, they seem to have an issue with file names starting with an '/'.


It writes fine to the storage, however, because there's a leading slash, the lifecycle policy system cant delete this file (lifecycle policy is an azure system that can automatically delete files in cold storage).





To quote Azure support:





> Update on 22/08: PG has addressed the issue and provided the workaround.


> Root Cause:


> Lifecycle management has hit a bug which prevents lifecycle policy from working on blobs which have start with “/” in their name.


> 


> Workaround:

by the policy.





Currently I do hourly backups within the mgob pod (which expire after 24 hours), but upload a daily backup to Azure cool storage. However GDPR guidelines force me (for good reason) to remove backups after a month. Azure Lifecycle Policy helps me to do this automatically. 





I am fully aware that this is an Azure issue, however, is it possible to remove the leading slash in the filename when uploading the file to Azure?





I'm not well versed in Go, but I can imagine removing a leading slash is something I can fix myself and submit a pull request. However am not sure if that would break something down the line (or if the PR will be accepted because technically this no issue in mgob).





So filing this issue to let you (and others) know that Azure Lifecycle Policy isn't working well with mgob, and possibly some tips for a workaround :)





Thanks and best regards,

This would enable us to replace all SSN numbers or other sensitive / GDPR related material (names, emails, ip adresses, etc) with hashes and thus avoid storing them in plain text while keeping the ability to search for a specific one. Many analysis would still work using this methodolody, like `groupby()`, even without hashing a string before searching.





In parsers one could generate a hash and either overwrite the source field, or generate a new field and drop the original one.





A query could look like this : 





`ssn = hash(""1234561234"", salt=""ssn"")`

Cross_ads promotedApp classes are moved from library module to crossads module


BitmapLoader, Utils are now in utils Package





**Fixes**


rewardedAd too many calls to load an ad





**Use as a local dependency**


From now in order to use api_android modules as inside local dependencies you should copy buildSrc folder from api_android project to your project root directory. 


Because of that, when testing new libraries or dependencies against api_android you should always updates both api_android and your root project buildSrc/Dependencies.kt files.





Core module still needs a bit work on delay between interstitial ads inside apps.

Things that should be done:





- [ ] Add a privacy page (at least in english with reference to gdpr-page)


  - [ ] explaining what the cookies do  (GDPR strong suggestion)


  - [ ] explaining what data is collected and why (**GDPR requirement**)


- [ ] Add option to disable all non required cookies (**GDPR requirement**)


- [ ] Add option for user to dump all his data (**GDPR requirement**)


- [ ] Add option to delete that data (**GDPR requirement**)

#1356 





# WHAT





I removed `Trackable` option of resource model (ex: `User`) from generator code.





# WHY





Most of devise_token_auth users would encountered following errors, because devise_token_auth's install command does not generate columns of Trackable option by default but in the model that was created by install command is including `:trackable` option.


So I want remove it.

### Description:


When I declare a custom blade directive, the argument's value is wrapped around '', which is not what I want. For example if I pass the string 


```php 


'gdpr-cookie-notice/script.js' 


``` 


as the argument, I'm expecting $script to be 


```php


""gdpr-cookie-notice/script.js""


``` 


and not 


```php


""'gdpr-cookie-notice/script.js'""


``` 


when using dd();





### Steps To Reproduce:


I have made a BladeServiceProvider to declare some directives like this one:


```php


    public function boot()


    {


        Blade::directive('script', function ($script) {


            dd($script);


        });


    }

When storing domain events in the event store, some of them contain person-related data, such as names, addresses, and so on. These data may need to be anonymized, pseudonymized, or even deleted. To be able to differ which domain events are affected and which aren't, we need a way to tell them apart. This means that for each event we save, we need to save an additional marker that tells whether the domain event contains potentially problematic data or not.





### What needs to be done to implement this feature?





- [ ] Introduce a new field to all event store implementations to mark events as relevant for GDPR


- [ ] Add a new parameter `containsPersonalData` (or something similar) to the `saveDomainEvents` function and use `true` as default

at first, thanks for your work on this plugin.





I've implemented vue-gtag with the boostraping strategy. GDPR also requires that users can opt out afterwords. So far I've implemented and optOut method to disable tracking, but can still see page tracking via GTM/GA Debug Chrome Plugin.





Is this the correct way to go for?








```


optOut() {


      setOptions({


        enabled: false,


      });





      this.SET_COOKIE_CONSENT_LAYER_DECLINED();


      bootstrap();


    },


```





Furthermore, is there a way where I can get the current configure options of vue-gtag within a component, e.g. to check if its enabled?





Thanks in advance and happy new year!

No other version is supported.





**Describe the bug**


Our Jira is in strict GDPR mode and only supports querying users by `accountId`. The [`_get_user_accountid`](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/blob/5c27f6ddafffc6110be1db4749fa67025852bcb6/jira/client.py#L1562) function fails in this instance.





**To Reproduce**


Steps to reproduce the behavior:


```


  issue = jira.create_issue(fields=issue_dict)


  assignee = 'my-user'


  jira.assign_issue(issue, assignee)


  assign(issue, assignee)


```


1. Further, we determine who to assign to dynamically. As the username is no longer returned by the API, we are not able to give [`assign_issue`](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/blob/5c27f6ddafffc6110be1db4749fa67025852bcb6/jira/client.py#L1572) the username.





**Expected behavior**


To be able to pass the `accountId` directly to [`assign_issue`](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira/blob/5c27f6ddafffc6110be1db4749fa67025852bcb6/jira/client.py#L1572).

## Pull request description





This PR enables developers to build GDPR compliant websites. GDPR affects all


website owners that target EU citizens.





In essence it will show a visitor a dialog wherein they can select their privacy


preferences. For example:





![Example of the consent dialog](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/preview_consent_dialog.png)





The preferences are stored in **functional** cookies so they are remembered.





**IMPORTANT**: it is still the responsibility of the developer/marketeer to


respect the visitors choices. Fork gives you the ability to do so.





### Configuration of the consent dialog





In the backend under ""Settings"" there is a new block which allows you to define


different privacy levels. You can add as many as needed. A visitor can agree to


each level separately.





![Configuration of the levels](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/configuration_of_levels.png)





For each level you need to add 2 translations, these translations will be used


in the consent dialog.





* Title, this is used as the label for the checkbox


* Text, this is used as a description for the level. As GDPR states a user needs


to make an informed disscision, so in the description you can describe what the


level means an how you will use the visitors agreement.





The reference code/name of the translation uses the level like explained below:





    {{ ('msg.PrivacyConsentLevel' ~ level|ucfirst ~ 'Title')|trans|raw }}


    {{ ('msg.PrivacyConsentLevel' ~ level|ucfirst ~ 'Text')|trans|raw }}





So for instance if you define the level ""statistics"" you will need to add 2


translations with the names:





* `PrivacyConsentLevelStatisticsTitle`


* `PrivacyConsentLevelStatisticsText`





<small>Remark: If you change the levels the consent dialog will be shown again


to all visitors. Previous choices will not be ticked.</small>





**There is one level that is always available: `functional`, this is always


allowed.** The user can not change this. It is added as it is a good practice to


explain your visitor what you store in these cookies.





### Usage





#### Retrieving choices in JavaScript


The choices of the visitor are available in `jsData` in the `privacyConsent`-object.





* `possibleLevels` contains all the levels that are defined thru the CMS.


* `levelsHash`, this is the hash that is used to determine if the levels are changed.


* `visitorChoices`, this contains the choice a user has made per level. The default is false.





#### Retrieving choices in PHP


A new service is available as `ForkCMS\Privacy\ConsentDialog`. This service


exposes some methods that you can use:





* `getLevels(bool $includeFunctional = false)`, this will return all the defined levels.


* `getVisitorChoices()`: returns an array with the users chosen preferences


* `hasAgreedTo(string $level)`: returns a boolean if the user has agreed to a given level. Returns false per default, also for non existing levels.





So for example if you want to do personalations if the user has agreed to the


`personalisation`-level, you can use the snippet below:





    if ($this->getContainer()->get(ForkCMS\Privacy\ConsentDialog::class)->hasAgreedTo('personalisation')) {


        ... your code ...


    }





#### Anonymize IP


Google Analytics has a feature called anonymizeIp. If you use our Google Analytics-


or Google Tag Manager integration we use the anonymizeIp feature by default.





In this case you need to add a privacy level with the name `statistics`. If you do


so, and the visitor agrees to it we will disable the IP anonymization.





<small>**Warning**: In Belgium this is not correct. The DPA decided that anonymizeIp


is not enough, therefor you should ask permission before tracking! See below how you


can achieve this.</small>





#### Google Tag Manager


If you use Google Tag Manager it is completely up to you to adhere the visitors


preferences. Below is explained on how it can be configured.





##### Create a variables


* Open Variables


* Click ""New"" next to ""User-Defined Variables""


* Name it ""Privacy Consent - DataLayer - Level XXX"", eg: Privacy Consent - DataLayer - Level statistics


* Choose ""Data Layer Variable"" for the type


* Use ""privacyConsentLevelXXXAgreed"" as the value for ""Data Layer Variable Name"", replace XXX with the ucfirst version of you level name


* Enable ""Set Default Value"", and set the Default Value to ""false""





![Example configuration for data layer variables](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_variable_configuration.png)





Do this for all the levels you defined.





##### Create triggers


* Open Triggers


* Click ""New""


* Name it ""Privacy Consent - Check - Level XXX not allowed"", eg: Privacy Consent - Check - Level statistics not allowed


* Choose ""Custom event"" for the Trigger Type


* Use "".*"" as Event name, and tick ""Use regex matching""


* Select ""Some custom Events""


* Select the relevant variable, something like DataLayer - Privacy Consent - Level XXX""


* Choose ""Equals"" as the condition and ""false"" as the value





![Not allowed trigger configuration](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_trigger_not_allowed_configuration.png)





* Click ""New""


* Name it ""Privacy Consent - Event - Level XXX - Agreed"", eg: Privacy Consent - Event - Level statistics - Agreed


* Choose ""Custom event"" for the Trigger Type


* Use ""privacyConsentLevelXXXAgreed"" as Event name, replace XXX with the ucfirst name of your level name


* Select ""All Custom Events""





![Event trigger configuration](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_trigger_event_configuration.png)





Repeat these steps for each level you have defined





##### Load a tag only when it is allowed


* Open the tag you want to configure. For instance Hotjar


* Edit the triggers


* Add ""Privacy Consent - Event - Level XXX - Agreed"" on the Firing Triggers. This will add the tag if the user agrees.


* Add ""Privacy Consent - Check - Level XXX not allowed"" on the Exceptions. This will prevent the tag from loading when the user did not agree.





![Tag configuration](https://testing.verkoyen.eu/forkcms/consent-dialog/gtm_tag_configuration.png)





By adding the exception the Tag won't be fired. This is the case when a visitor


has not agreed to anything. In that case the consent dialog is shown.


When the visitor clicks ""Save my preferences"", we will fire an event per agreed


level: `privacyConsentLevelXXXAgreed`. This will fire the tag, as it is configured


as a Firing trigger.





If the visitor visits another page the exception won't be triggered as the variable


is true. So the tag will be fired by the ""All Pages"" trigger.





### Removed features


Adding new features also means cleaning up non relevant features, so some are removed:





### Cookie bar


This new Consent Dialog replaces the previous Cookie Bar.





This means you can't use the following methods anymore:





* `$this->get('fork.cookie')->hasAllowedCookies()`


* `$this->get('fork.cookie')->hasHiddenCookieBar()`





### Visitor Id


The visitor Id that was generated and stored in a cookie does not exist anymore.


If you rely on it you should build this feature yourself.","2020-02-26T11:50:58Z","2020-08-17T20:00:38Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

I never applied a tax plugin since I thought I read that this plugin has that built in. It's possible this is related to https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-services/issues/1867.





When I reviewed some of the tax rates at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=tax&section=standard`, multiple rates don't appear accurate. Additionally, it appears Colorado sales tax are primarily based on the Jurisdiction Codes for a County or City. WC has Zip and City but I don't understand how that translates to these Jurisdiction Codes.





I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this without either entering rates manually (which, I can't really use the Jurisdiction Code) or using another plugin. If I decide to install the Taxjar plugin, is it any different than what this plugin is already importing from Taxjar?





For reference, I think the most current rates can be found here:

Thanks for the help.

EDIT: September 22, 2020





For purposes of privacy, adhering to GDPR, and to protect identities, I am giving estimated addresses that duplicate the same rates and issues as the original addresses.





I tested this on both a staging site and live site, getting the same incorrect tax rate.





**Origin address**


26851 Rd P


Dolores, Colorado 81323





**Destination address**


4634 Simms St.


Wheat Ridge, CO 80033





For this destination address, I added one product for $20.95.

The tax rate being applied is 4.5%, which is what was imported into WooCommerce at some point, found at `wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=tax&section=standard`:

[According to TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/sales-tax-calculator/), the rate should be 8%:

I would have loved to talk about it in Porto ... so maybe next year :-)





Anyway, after reading you current docs and checking the available consent categories it feels to me, that you currently focus primarily on ""stored data"". Like cookies, local browser storage, WebSQL, etc.





This is neglecting the _other_ major requirement of GDPR, getting consent before sending any **personal information** to any 3rd Party. In particular this will impact all Google Maps, Youtube, Vimeo, Google Fonts, and so on includes, where a Plugin / Theme / Site includes something from a 3rd Party server and the users IP is sent to this 3rd Party vendor. As the IP is personal information, this must not happen without consent.





I would kindly ask to keep in mind, that a generic Consent API is not all about Cookies (although we all like Cookies for sure!).


Concluding, I would suggest to add another category already named something like ""3rd Party Tools"" which will facilitate for all ""Tools"" being served from 3rd Party Servers and serve the purporse to add additional value to the User Experience, the functionality of the page as well as additional, media content.





In an ideal world, I would also suggest to change the docs, regarding your current categories, to make clear, that e.g. ""Analytics"" is not just about the Analytics cookie being stored, but also that personal information is being tracked by a 3rd Party.





If you agree and like, I can go on with a PR regarding this.

Please describe.**


We can only show personalised ads if the user has consented to personalisation. On canonical pages, this is handled using the personalisation cookie. On AMP pages, this is handled using [amp-consent](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-consent/).





We can use the `data-block-on-consent` and `data-npa-on-unknown-consent` attributes on the `amp-ad` component:





- If the user has responded affirmatively to the amp-consent component (user accepts the consent prompt), ads will be requested normally.





- If the user has responded negatively to the amp-consent component (user rejects the consent prompt), non-personalized ads will be requested.


    - If the user’s response to the amp-consent is unknown (user dismisses the consent prompt)


        - By default, no ad requests are sent at all


        - If `data-npa-on-unknown-consent` is set to true, non-personalized ads will be requested





This will need to be merged and tested on the test environment.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

**Testing notes**


- Unit tests to ensure that we are passing the correct attributes to amp ads


- The amp-ads component should also have its own testing around what is requested.


- Can we have any integration testing to ensure that the ads received are personalised or not?





Dev insight: Will Cypress tests be required or are unit tests sufficient? Will there be any potential regression? etc

I am just going through your HTML5 Web Component Fundamentals course on Pluralsight... I am a complete beginner with some mandatory holidays, caused by the virus, so I decided to create a web application. I have written macros in excel before, and a few macros for a 3D design software both using VB, but that is about all my coding knowledge. I have watched about 45 hours of Pluralsight courses in 4 days, and I struggle to find the relevant things, as most beginner videos explain the basics too basic, but don't go into details on the genuinely new info. (I don't even need coding to understand what an if - else statement is - my mom shouted it at me enough as a child -, but what on earth is git? Sure I downloaded and installed it to follow the demos, now what, will it scan my entire computer and sell all my personal data???)  Yes I have very serious trust issues.





Your course was the first one that I actually started to find interesting, and the one that made most sense.





As I am drowning in resources - there are 95+hrs of Pluralsight courses on HTML CSS and JS (basics), purely on how to write these from scratch - a common element in these courses is: ""Here is how you do it from scratch on your own, but don't do that, here is 5 alternatives for - libraries, frameworks etc. but you also have to learn these on top of what you just learned, they will introduce issues with dependencies, and you will struggle to switch between these. Good luck!!""





So 5th day into learning web application development I think I would like to go down the Full Stack route, assuming I understood that term right (Developing both Front and Rear end) and re-invent every wheel that rolls my way. <joke>Luckily as a Mechanical Design Engineer working in Motorsports, that's also what I do when I am not on holiday</joke>





After the essay, here are the questions:


- Whats your preferred method of deploying your web applications? 


- Why? 


- How are you certain that they are safe, both from hackers and from the third party you are/may be deploying it through? (I have trust issues with completely free resources that just say ""promise we won't look"" in a fancy formatted document)





The app I am developing (a demo for - as a first project) exists already and was created in the early 2000s and is unsupported now. It handles personal data, and while I will not input any real GDPR sensitive data into my demo app, I would like to begin development with the condition that it must be THAT secure. 





- What are 'Must have'-s even if I try to go about it the 'From Scratch' way?


- Do you have any more courses that go into detail on any of the topics I mentioned in my essay? (Security, frameworks and libraries, 'New Starter - kit' of 'Must Have'-s?


- If you personally don't, can you recommend certain courses to watch, read, work through?





Thank you!

## Purpose





Some browsers that support localStorage do weird things like stop you from putting anything in it in private mode. This means visitors using those browsers can't get past the GDPR TOS prompt.





So what we're doing here is testing setting something in localStorage and then, if that doesn't work, repurposing it to create (or update or remove) a cookie.

### Description


When trying to authenticate with JIRA during first request, I get an error saying I can't use username.





### Reproduction


```python


jac = jira.JIRA(


    server=""https://<myorg>.atlassian.net/"",


    basic_auth=(account_id, api_token),


    options={""rest_api_version"": 3},


)


users = jac.search_users(""example-user"")


```





I've tried passing in username, display-name and email instead of `account_id`, and password instead of `api_token`, and still I get an error





### Expected behaviour


Successful authentication.

Une PR qui vise à supprimer les popups de cookies consent pour avoir des screenshots plus propre, lors de l'analyse.


Pour retirer les popups cookies et autre bannière GDPR, il n'y a pas d'autres moyens que d'utiliser une extension (https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v3.1.0&show=api-working-with-chrome-extensions). J'ai donc créé 'cookout' qui supprime ces bannières.


On passe donc d'un screen pas top à qqchose de plus lisible. 


Seulement pour pouvoir utiliser une extension avec puppeteer, il faut passer `headless: true`. Sans doute ça prend plus de mémoire ? Je te laisse juge

While we are not a W3C spec, it is a useful tool in evaluating our security and privacy posture. To this end I have attempted to answer the following questions for the CMCD project:





1. What information might this feature expose to Web sites or other parties, and for what purposes is that exposure necessary?


    1. This spec relays information from a media player to the CDN from which it is requesting media objects. The information concerns attributes of the object being requested (such as bitrate, duration, object type), the state of the player (buffer level, rebuffering status, startup mode) and the session (sessionID and contentID). The exposure is necessary because it allows the CDN to a) optimize delivery of the object b) apply intelligent timeouts and retry thresholds c) Analyze disparate requests as being a playback session and d) trigger immediate network health alerts for poor performance. 


2. Is this specification exposing the minimum amount of information necessary to power the feature?


    1. Yes, we believe so. Over 35 data points were originally proposed, of which we have accepted 16. We have evaluated each on the litmus test of ""is it necessary"" and ""what is the benefit""? For each key/value pair accepted, we have a clear value proposition. 


3. How does this specification deal with personal information or personally-identifiable information or information derived thereof?


    1. All PII is explicitly prohibited. The spec indicates that ""Personally Identifiable Information, such as IP address, cookie information and location data is intentionally not carried by the specification. ""


4. How does this specification deal with sensitive information?


    1. None of the defined keys carry sensitive information, such as  financial data, health information, location, or credentials. 


5. Does this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?


    1. The ""sessionID"" key is the only data point that persists across requests. This ID is required to be a GUI and the UUID standard is suggested. It ties together the audio, video and manifest requests when a particular asset is played. It is never used twice, even if the same user plays another assets, or the same asset is repeatedly viewed by the end user. It cannot be used to identify the user, or the content and it does not persist across browsing sessions. 


6. What information from the underlying platform, e.g. configuration data, is exposed by this specification to an origin?


    1. Of the reserved keys, the ones closest to configuration data would be requested maximum throughput and buffer length. These can conceivably be set differently players at levels that could be averaged over time and then used as part of a fingerprinting surface. To mitigate this, the spec requires these values to be rounded to the nearest 100mbps. This bucketing lowers the entropy associated with these parameters and thus reduces the fingerprinting surface. An explicit key called 'DeviceID' was proposed but then removed from the spec due to fingerprinting concerns.  


7. Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user’s device


    1. No it does not. 


8. What data does this specification expose to an origin? Please also document what data is identical to data exposed by other features, in the same or different contexts.


    1. The spec exposes the following information to an origin. In manby cases, the origin already has access to this information if it were to parse the object being delivered


        1. Encoded bitrate - the bitrate of the media object being requested . Origin can discover by parsing. 


        1. Buffer length - the buffer length of the media player


        1. Buffer starvation -  a Boolean flag indicating if a rebuffer event has taken place since the last object was requested. 


        1. Content ID - A unique string identifying the current content. This does not increase information leakage, as the object URL is visible to the receiver and itself a reference to the content. This ID simply ties together the thousands of separate objects which comprise a media asset. 


        1. Object duration - the media time duration of the object. Origin can discover by parsing. 


        1. Deadline - the minimum time for the CDN to deliver the object before the player rebuffers. 


        1. Measured throughput - the throughput between client and server as measured by the client


        1. Next object request - the next object the client intends to request. This is used to request a prefetch by the CDN edge. Must be a relative path to the current request. 


        1. Next range request - a range request associated with the next object request. 


        1. Object type	 - whether the current file represents an audio, video, init, caption, or manifest file. 


        1. Playback rate - current playback speed of the player


        1. Requested maximum throughput -  a means for a player to voluntarily ask for delivery to be throttled. 


        1. Streaming format - type of media presentation, such as HLS or DASH. 


        1. Session ID - a randomly generated GUID, such as UUID, used to tie together object requests across a single piece of media. 


        1. Stream type - live or VOD


        1. Startup	 - boolean true if the player is in start/seeking/recovery mode.


        1. CMCD version - version to accommodate future updates. Not sent if version == 1. 


9. Does this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms?


    1. No. 


10. Does this specification allow an origin to access other devices?


    1. No. 


11. Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent’s native UI?


    1. No, this is client to server communication, not server to client. 


12. What temporary identifiers might this this specification create or expose to the web?


    1. The SessionID can be considered a temporary identifier. It is randomly generated, never repeats for the same user and is never reused for other sessions. 


13. How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?


    1. The first party receiver of the data is the CDN serving the media objects. The CDN will log this information in its delivery log files. Log files are considered proprietary data of the customer whose content is being delivered. These log files are subject to privacy constraints, such as GDPR. 


14. How does this specification work in the context of a user agent’s Private Browsing or ""incognito"" mode?


    1. A media player may optionally send the CMCD data. The spec does not restrain whether the data should be sent when a browser-based player is in Private Browsing mode. 


15. Does this specification have a ""Security Considerations"" and ""Privacy Considerations"" section?


    1. Yes, Section 5 deals with security and privacy concerns. 


16. Does this specification allow downgrading default security characteristics?


   1. This allows data to be attached to a HTTP request. If this request is made over http, then it is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks and any attacker would be able to view the information being sent to the server. Use of a HTTPS request would mitigate this attack.","2020-06-16T22:22:26Z","2020-07-23T18:24:55Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"
"https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/324",641208223,14,1,"0","","Design for law complliance","Design for law complliance","Design for law complliance","Privacy Considerations for service endpoints","Prior to PING and linked to our many [layering discussions in SDS](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store/issues/80), our Privacy Considerations section and [10.4 Herd Privacy](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#herd-privacy) in particular might be reviewed. 





[5.7](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#service-endpoints) says: ""One of the primary purposes of a DID document is to enable discovery of service endpoints."" The Privacy Considerations section does a good job of discussing correlation risks in general but is light on the risks and mitigations related to service endpoints.





As I understand it, the relationship between pseudonymous DIDs, herd immunity, and service endpoints implies that, in all ""Privacy by Design"" use-cases, the number of service endpoints SHOULD be one in order to reduce the risk of correlation and enhance the effectiveness of Herd Privacy.





[Requesting Parties](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/248#issuecomment-645486701) who discover a pseudonymous DID by whatever means, especially a search of ""de-identified"" metadata in various directories, SHOULD be directed to some kind of **consent-based access control service** with a minimum loss of entropy. This is especially important for DID methods that consider mitigation the GDPR Right to be Forgotten and in light of the fact that GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA all allow unlimited use of de-identified data with little concern on enforcement of re-identification.





My suggestion would be to enhance the Privacy Considerations section with a discussion of how access control services could be proxied or otherwise ""tumbled"" by a herd privacy intermediary that could be chosen by the DID controller or data subject independently of the access control service or not. It would then be up to the DID controller to decide whether to use a dumb proxy mechanism like TOR or an access control service that provides herd privacy as the one service endpoint in a pseudonymous DID.","2020-06-18T13:27:52Z","2021-02-21T21:25:02Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

Displays a cookie acceptance dialog if you have not provided an answer in a prior visit. Handles light and dark mode.





## Reviewer Notes


You can play around with this by looking at the Application tab in Chrome's dev tools and clearing out the cookie (`newrelic-gdpr-consent`) or changing its value.

First up, I don't see a banner, initially I took it that I need to implement that myself and simply set `gatsby-gdpr-facebook-pixel` once the user accepts.  So I decided to use `react-cookie-consent` and set this cookie on the `onAccept` event, works to a point but I need to refresh the page for the pixel to load so I tried to send a `window.fbq(""consent"", ""grant"")` but no luck.





So looking through the issues, I see that I should see a banner, I don't, but the further question would be, can I change the appearance of this banner? I can't see anything in the docs/code.


https://github.com/andrezimpel/gatsby-plugin-gdpr-cookies/issues/4#issuecomment-583735299





So if I was to use `react-cookie-consent` to implement the banner, how would I initialise the pixel on accept?

We should have account configuration settings available in Prebid Server.





In addition to validating that an account (publisher id) is known to the prebid-server, account-specific configurations would be needed to support planned functionality. The Java version has the following per-account configurations, for example:





- eventsEnabled: to control win notification events such as #1202 or video impression tracking #1015


- enforceGdpr


- bannerCacheTtl


- videoCacheTtl


- analyticsSamplingFactor





PBS-Go has a simple yaml accounts list in legacy code, not used for openrtb2 endpoints and with the current definition as a list of strings, only useful for validation. PBS-Java supports a yaml file with a more complex structure, and a database source.





### Implementation





For implementation, supporting the same data sources as PBS-Java could be useful to some extent and the ability to refresh the data in flight is needed as well. The HTTP api source is well suited for this purpose, even more versatile than the database in my opinion. FileFetcher less so (I will create a ticket for separate discussion on this).

This PR uses the [Nginx JS Module](https://www.nginx.com/blog/introduction-nginscript/) to check query params in the incoming requests, and filter out any that match the Email regex.





I see this as a first step in supporting log filtering, if needed I think we can expand it and formalise an API around the JS modules, to make it easier to add new filters or instance specific filters. But I would rather wait until we have a clearer understanding of what we would need before trying to solve that problem 😄 . 





## How to Test


**Testing with filtering enabled**


1. Clone the branch


1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build`


1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`


1. Using the browser (or curl) go to http://localhost:50132/?email=john.smith@smith.com


1. In the nginx logs you should see `email=[EMAIL FILTERED]`, like the screenshots





**Testing with filtering disabled**


1. Stop the docker containers session if it's still running


1. Change the [`FILTER_LOGS` param](https://github.com/degica/barcelona/pull/601/files#diff-71027439e4e13f5ebb931f5ea1f97b66R14) to ""false"" (or remove it entirely)


1. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`


1. Using the browser (or curl) go to http://localhost:50132/?email=john.smith@smith.com


1. In the nginx logs you should see `email=john.smith@smith.com`

I strongly suggest you change the default lifetime of cookies created by Amplitude SDKs to match this requirement (12 months). Here is a screenshot of cookies created by Amplitude JS SDK at https://nrn-v2-mst-aptd-at-lcz-sty-c1-amplitude-g.vercel.app/fr

This single violation of the GDPR makes Amplitude non GDPR compliant (according to my attorney).





Also, I haven't found any way of changing that behavior through configuration of the JS SDK at https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/javascript-sdk-reference, and I suggest such option gets added for people who'd have even stricter rules regarding cookies (or to gracefully handle any future change in the GDPR itself, regarding this particular matter).","2020-07-20T18:50:46Z","2020-11-05T07:03:16Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

I'm new to github and have run out of ideas on why I've seen a significant drop in prebid revenue and cpm since we released LiveRamp's CMP on our site earlier this week. 





We're running Prebid version 3.18.0


We released the Liveramp CMP across our site (cv-library.co.uk) at the beginning of the week. Since then I have seen Prebid revenue drop off a cliff and both Google AdX and Adsense CPM's have dropped by half. 





When I debug Prebid on the site (e.g. https://www.cv-library.co.uk/accountancy-jobs?pbjs_debug=true) I can see the CMP load, when I consent I then see the consent string present. 


I can also see that on the surface it appears we are providing the consent string in our Bid requests to partners (see attached sshot). 


There are other prebid calls on the page (different versions) that relate to other partners loaded in our ad server which I'm not too concerned about for the time being. 





It looks like both the GDPR Consent Module and GDPR Enforcement Module are working as expected. 





What i can't explain is why our Prebid partners have stopped bidding or are bidding at a much lower rate. 





If anyone can provide any suggestions I'm all ears. 





First thoughts are:


Some sort of Timeout issue


CMP is interfering with the bid requests in some way...


There is an issue with the Prebid version we are using


Under Vendor data the 'cmpVersion' is set to '1' - should this not be '2'


<img width=""1429"" alt=""Screenshot 2020-07-22 at 10 48 00"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68640428/88162436-4275a680-cc09-11ea-9742-9bec7d4911e0.png"">





I can see another thread related to Quantcast here that sounds similar to the issue we are having - https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/5462





I've contacted Prebid partners and am waiting to hear back as well as discussions with LiveRamp but nothing as yet has presented itself as the potential issue.





If anyone can take a look and advise at all I'd be extremely grateful!!





Many thanks





Matt

As an IT-Administrator I need to delete files according to GDPR. In a lot of cases it is required to make sure that a deleted file cannot be restored, so I need a way to securely erase files in Powershell. 


The cmdlet should be native in powershell, so you don't have to install any additional software





## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)





I think the implementation should be in the original Remove-Item cmdlet. If I add the argument ""-Secure"", I want the file to be overridden.


Override-Content: The most basic function would be to override all bytes the file uses on the harddisk with zeroes. In other cases it may be required to override the bytes with random values.


Repetitions: It may also be required to enter a number of repetions for the override if one override is not sufficient.


Example: Remove-Item C:\Users\Tobias\Secret -Recurse -Secure random -Rep 3


^--> This cmd should securely erase C:\Users\Tobias\Secret with all subfolders and files by overriding all sectors that contain content of the affected files on the volume three times with a random sequence and of course remove the entry in the MFT as before.","2020-07-24T10:41:29Z","2020-07-30T00:00:19Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

At Indeed we have need of a mechanism to sanitize requests of PII in order to maintain GDPR and CCPA requirements. I'm certain many other companies have this need, and expect this to also be useful for companies requiring HIPPA compliance.





The existing hideStringAndNumericLiterals and hideLiterals functions look to be well suited for this purpose. Here I've exported these functions, along with printWithReducedWhitespace which is a nice companion to both. I've updated the existing test for `hideLiterals` to cover more scenarios and added a test for `hideStringAndNumericLiterals`.

The third party tool used is cookiebot.com - account is registered on frie.p@correlaid.org, password is stored in bitwarden. 
the free version of cookiebot scans once per month for new cookies. this should give us enough time to adapt in case we add new cookies through third party services (e.g. calendly adds a cookie).

This PR also removes unnecessary cookies such as for the correlaidx navbar and for twitter.com (we now use the hugo embedding which does not rely on cookies). The latter is not yet reflected in the cookie consent because this was updated after the initial scan. 

The calendly widget is now only shown when the marketing (renamed to ""social media features and third party services"") cookies are accepted. otherwise we have a button that leads to the calendly website.

This PR enabled the TCFv2 compliant CMP for all non-US users, this is implemented using https://www.npmjs.com/package/@guardian/consent-management-platform.





[**Trello Card**](https://trello.com/c/AH8m5Soz/3242-upgrade-to-tcfv2-cmp-on-supporttheguardiancom)





## Changes





- Upgrade `@guardian/consent-management-platform` to v4 (TCFv2 compliant support).


- Update `page.js` to call `cmp.init` using the new interface exposed by `@guardian/consent-management-platform`  v4.


- Update `thirdPartyTrackingConsent.js` to use the new `onConsentChange` function exposed by `@guardian/consent-management-platform`.  `onConsentChange` takes a callback that it executes with consent state, passed as the parameter `state`.  The value of `state` will differ when in CCPA mode (US users) and TCFv2 mode (everyone else), so the callback determines which mode we're in, and returns either ""OptedIn"" or ""OptedOut"". There is no longer an ""Unset"" (null) state, so this has been removed from the code base.


- Remove logic used to read/write the `GU_TK` cookie from thirdPartyTrackingConsent.js`.


- Remove the old-CMP component (`ConsentBanner.jsx`), it's associated styles.


- I've removed the `ccpaEnabled` switch, this was in place to fallback to the old-CMP if necessary when releasing the CCPA  CMP, I don't think there's value in this now as we're removing the old-CMP in this PR.

User profiles stores personal information, but only a UserID and Email is required. These profiles can for a person, or for an organization to allow participation as a group.


#### Details:


- **User profile:** The current version of Codalab v2 does not allow users to edit their profile. This functionality will be implemented (Figure 3). Integration of user accounts on different components (CodaBench, Codalab, ChaGrade) will be supported if needed. User’s profiles will include (* means mandatory; to protect anonymity, only a contact email is required to identify users)


- **Organizations as User:** This will allow users to organize competitions and participate in them as a group. However, being a member of an organization is not mandatory to organize/participate a challenge/benchmark. This will also allow the platform to give credits to organization members for organizing competitions or participating in them (in their visible profile). To claim organizing a challenge or participating in it, an organization member will need to have been a member of that organization at least some time during the active period of the competition. This feature could replace both the notion of teams and of admins. To avoid sharing passwords, a member of an organization, logged in with his own personal ID, could switch to any organization he/she is a member of.

Here, I've changed the `allowed_schemas` trait to explicitly list all event properties that should be recorded based on their name or category. This can be used to filter-out personal data.





Summary of the changes made:


* `allowed_schemas` can now be a dictionary describing *what* data to keep when recording an event (see example below).


* schemas require a `categories` field under each property. This field can be used to group properties.


* `unrestricted` is a special category that means the named property will always be recorded when that event is recorded.





## How it works





`allowed_schemas` is now a nested dictionary where the keys are the schema IDs, and the values are dictionaries with two optional fields, `properties` and `categories`, describing the properties in the event that should be recorded.





As an example, 


```python


allowed_schemas = {


    ""uri.to.schema"": {


        ""allowed_properties"": [""name"", ""email""],


        ""allowed_categories"": [""personal-information""]


    }


}








c.EventLog.allowed_schemas=allowed_schemas


```


When the `uri.to.schema` event is recorded, it will include the properties, `email` and `name`, **and** any other properties with the category label `personal-information`. All other properties will not be recorded.





## Personal data





While this PR doesn't specifically address personal data, it provides a mechanism to filter out personal data. For example, properties can be labeled with categories like `hippa`, `gdpr`, `pii`, etc. to make filtering under different regimes possible.","2020-08-24T16:07:01Z","2020-09-09T18:00:01Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

This PR:





* adds buttons to the settings page to create the privacy or cookie policy pages


* these buttons are built via a helper function [`render_secondary_button`](https://github.com/humanmade/altis-consent/wiki/Altis-Consent-Public-Functions#settingsrender_secondary_button)


* when these buttons are clicked, we hijack the `$_POST` handling to run the logic to create the pages


* the code is based on [how core does it](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-admin/options-privacy.php#L49-L79) but abstracted a bit so we can reuse the same code for both the cookie and privacy policy pages (or other pages that could be added later


* adds a new `cookie-policy.php` which is where the default cookie policy page content is handled


* this policy content is based on [the EU cookie policy content](https://github.com/Really-Simple-Plugins/complianz-gdpr/blob/1ffaff06cbe3c70758f7dd81fc40de257f3d8b0c/config/documents/cookie-policy-eu.php) in the [Complianz](https://github.com/Really-Simple-Plugins/complianz-gdpr) plugin.


* new filters to control various bits of this functionality (all documented in the Filters documentation) including changing the content of the cookie policy page.





A filter exists to disable Gutenberg support for the new cookie policy page that's created which defaults to `true` (Gutenberg enabled)

Bug





## Description


While gdprEnforcement module is used and purpose: ""storage"" is set to false in prebid setConfig(), prebid debugging in console reports ""WARNING: TCF2: enforcing P1 and P2"". I don't know if this is a bug on logging or it actually enforces P1 regardless of configuration.





## Steps to reproduce


Using gdprEnforcement module with the following configuration


                consentManagement: {


                    gdpr: {


                        cmpApi: ""iab"",


                        timeout: 20000,


                        defaultGdprScope: true,


                        rules: [{


                            purpose: ""storage"",


                            enforcePurpose: false,


                            enforceVendor: false


                        }]


                    },


                    usp: {


                        cmpApi: ""iab"",


                        timeout: 100


                    }


                }





## Test page

### Expected results


I shouldn't get a warning about P1 being enforced





### Actual results

SELECT SQL queries and django get() should be able to view the decrypted emails.

#### Changes proposed in this Pull Request





* Layout: AsyncLoad `GdprBanner` in `LayoutLoggedOut`.





#### Testing instructions





* Delete the `sensitive_pixel_option` cookie if you have it.


* Go to  http://calypso.localhost:3000?flags=gdpr-banner


* If you're not in a GDPR-enabled country, you will have to enable `isCurrentUserMaybeInGdprZone` to return `true`.


* Verify you can still see the GDPR banner.","2020-10-02T20:35:51Z","2020-10-06T12:09:11Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**





```gherkin


Feature: Delete user data as admin


  As admin


  I want to delete all personal data of a user account, including posts and comments


  In order to comply with GDPR


```





If you disabled a user account as admin then this user cannot login anymore. Then this user can also not delete his/her user account anymore. If the user requests deletion of data e.g. by mail then we don't have an UI for that.





**Describe the solution you'd like**

Looks like it might the culprit behind https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/46206 and https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/46211





### Testing





Same as for https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/46212 (which will then be not needed)





Visit `/domains/manage/` and make sure the layout is correct:

Unless you have a paid Zapier account, then users are limited to 100 zaps/month, which is potentially not enough for a small–mid-sized membership site. And even with Zapier, it introduces an unnecessary 3rd step between JetEngine and a mailing list service. And the inbuilt 'send email' function is limited in terms of design options, which doesn't make a great impression on new users.

Therefore, I request further integrations with a wider range of mailing list services, removing the need for Zapier. My personal request is for Mailerlite, since they have a more flexible free pricing plan than MailChimp and offer good GDPR solutions for EU-based websites/customers/members. 

Adding more integrations, will immediately ease the workflow in JetEngine when registering new users or subscribing them to mailing lists. It will also provide greater flexibility and choice to JetEngine users, when deciding which mailing list service to use and when deciding whether to buy JetEngine or another membership plugin. For example, they may need to transfer existing mailing lists over to JetEngine profile builder and might not want the added complication/limitation of using Zapier. This will make JetEngine a more competitive choice compared with other site-membership plugins.

Elementor already has a wide range of 3rd party mailing list vendors for their form widgets. But this cannot be used by most JetEngine users when managing new user/member registrations. This use case is particularly crucial for JetEngine subscribers.","2020-10-09T06:35:48Z","2022-11-28T08:23:52Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

**Description of Change:**


Clients were concerned that our documentation stated ""users’ associated event data will still exist"" even after a delete request from a GDPR compliance point of view. This sentence was misleading since a user's events are actually deleted entirely, it is merely aggregate event counts that remain unaltered. This is already covered in above alert box and explained in a FAQ, hence I'm proposing to remove this sentence to avoid further misunderstandings.





Closes #**ISSUE_NUMBER_HERE**

I decided to turn off uBO and try out AdNauseam.


The config and the lists setup in uBO and AdNauseam are identical


So I was expecting AdNauseam to be hiding crap as good as uBO.


In practice, it turned to be not as expected, and the following crap started being visible after I switched:


- Popups and overlays related to cookies / gdpr & terms of use / privacy terms / privacy notice / such stuff on all websites.


- Advertised search results on Startpage.


- Maybe something more that I no longer remember.





Doubt that ""Your settings"" and ""Your filter lists"" play any role here, as mentioned they are identical in uBO and AdNauseam, and uBO cuts all the bad stuff very well.





Am I doing something wrong?


Or is it an expected behavior of AdNauseam cutting the stuff not as effectively as uBO?


In case of the latter, I should keep both uBO and AdNauseam active, and configure them in a way that they have no match in active settings and lists (active in the former, disabled in the latter), to cut the crap and in the same time let AdNauseam do its mission, are there any recommendations on how to do it the best / most practical way?

This can become a vulnerability for the codebase, especially with a codebase built for one org and then genericized - that one org's policy documentation can easily change (especially after a political change). The risk is a dead link and a codebase that's no longer Standard compliant.





I would suggest a standard policy file that copies the policy and links to the original source with a date (like we do here:

I'm not sure if this is a good way of solving these problems, so I'd like some feedback on what people think. It feels kind of convoluted and especially tacking it on now to the authentication system (that assumed a 2-state model) makes it a bit awkward (there's now 3 states: not logged in, logged in, and logged in but jailed).





This makes it possible for a user to be authenticated while not being able to use the main APIs, but only a subset, the ""jailed"" ones. This is useful if:





1. The user has not finished signing up (e.g. has not finished adding a location)


2. The user has not accepted TOS/GDPR/etc


3. The user is banned, but we'd like to show them something nicer than a ""you're banned"" at login





It makes it easy to add requirements, e.g. update a privacy policy and make sure everyone has agreed to them, or add required fields to a user profile.

**Name:** Databunker


**Category:** software/cloud/


**URL:** https://databunker.org/





## Description





Databunker is a GDPR compliant user store service for Web and mobile apps. Databunker is a combination of several software concepts build together to provide PII storage and **privacy by design** out of the box:





* Personal identifiable information (PII) storage and vault


* Secure session storage for web applications


* Privacy portal for customers


* Application backend server


* DPO management tool


* Tokenization service


* Secret sauce





Databunker provides Nodejs examples for easy onboarding:





https://github.com/securitybunker/hello-nodejs-passport-js-magic-link-databunker











## Why I am making the suggestion





Originally I developed Databunker to help me to store customer data in a full GDPR compliant way. It grew to be a full-featured solution standing stringent privacy requirements.








## My connection with the software





I am a product author. Contact me at yuli@privacybunker.io for any questions.





- [x] I will keep the issue up-to-date if something I have said changes or I remember a connection with the software.

I am calling the setuid endpoint with a consent string which contains no consent information at all about my vendor id, but a cookie is dropped anyway. I did not changed the gdpr.enabled value so it's true by default according to config.go. In my pbs.yaml I have these settings about gdpr : 


```


gdpr:

        timeouts_ms.init_vendorlist_fetches: 1000

Both media notification in android notifications and media symbol on tab list, show that music is paused and offers to play it.

Cookies were found to have the ""Secure"" flag  set to false. If a cookie is not marked as “Secure,” it may be transmitted over an insecure connection whether or not the session with the host is secure. In other words, it may be be transmitted over an HTTP connection. If an attacker can intercept a cookie intended to be transmitted over a secure channel, the attacker may be able to get access to secure session tokens or other authentication information.

### Recommendation

It is recommended to enable the ""secure"" flag to instruct the browser to only send the cookie if the request is sent using a secure channel.

More information on this type of vulnerability can be found at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag#Setting_the_Secure_Flag and https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly#Mitigating_the_Most_Common_XSS_attack_using_HttpOnly

There are multiple ways to enable this, one of which is to set it within the
response header:

Set-Cookie: <name>=<value>[; <Max-Age>=<age>]
[; expires=<date>][; domain=<domain_name>]
[; path=<some_path>][; secure][; HttpOnly]

The context table below provides the source and the type of cookie which was found to be vulnerable.

The application was found to use weak cryptographic algorithms during app runtime. These methods are usually easily reverse engineered, so the data is not really protected very well. An attacked with access to the encrypted data could easily see the data that was obfuscated.##Evaluation Criteria
It is a best practice not to use insecure methods to encrypt data. However, not all companies require this. The context table below should be evaulated against the standards for the app. Also, please note there is a separate finding specifically for sensitive data being encrypted using these methods.

### Recommendation

Change to using algrythms that are secure. Guidance can be found [for Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/cryptography) and [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/cryptoservices/GeneralPurposeCrypto/GeneralPurposeCrypto.html).

The information specified has been found within local application folders or external storage locations on the device. Data written to device storage can be accessed through several attack vectors.  An attacker who is able to access the charging port may be able to access this data if the user acknowledges the trust or with a rooted/jailbroken device. Often, data backup utilities can also export local files with its backup and, if not encrypted, can be then accessed by an attacker. While malware is also a concern, it is less common than attacks concerning physical device access. If these values are exposed they can be used to track and phish users, access their account, or circumvent protections within the app.

### Recommendation

Sensitive data should not be stored in local app files without the right protection level and unencrypted. It is highly recommended to encrypt all locally stored sensitive data using a strong encryption algorithm. It is also recommended to set the strongest possible data protection level on the file containing the sensitive data. Review the data protection level(s) set on the file(s) listed here and ensure that they are either `NSFileProtectionComplete` for complete protection or `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication` to be protected until the user first authenticates to the device. Details and code snippets can be found at  [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/encrypting_your_app_s_files](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/encrypting_your_app_s_files)

To comply with privacy laws around the world, reCaptcha [should be blocked](https://complianz.io/google-recaptcha-and-the-gdpr-a-possible-conflict/) until the user has consented to marketing level cookies. We have developed an API, eventually to get merged into WP Core, which offers plugins a method to communicate the consent status to each other: cookie management plugins can set consent, other plugins can set cookies according to the consent status set by the cookie management plugins (currently supported by Complianz and Cookiebot). 





The Consent API proposal for WordPress can be found here:


https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/04/01/feature-plugin-proposal-wp-consent-api/


Github:


https://github.com/rlankhorst/wp-consent-level-api





To demonstrate how this can work, we have created an integration with the WP Consent API for Contact Form 7. You can view a working example here: https://wpconsentapi.org/contact-form-7/





To enable this feature, installing the WP Consent API is required.





The advantage of using the WP Consent API, is that it will work for each plugin that supports it. 





If the WP Consent API is not active, or if there is no  cookie management plugin, it will function as before. If these are active, consent will be asked if required (opt in, e.g. EU, UK) or it will be possible to opt out (e.g. US, CA).  





Currently the index.js file, which was changed, is not minified, as that will be handled by your release I haven't done this. 





Please let me know if you have any questions about this. 





Merging this branch won't harm existing users, but will offer your users the option to make their site compliant, as required by law in many countries.","2021-03-11T15:40:35Z","2021-03-12T08:33:54Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

=======





The Khan saves player name as plain text on the database, what isn't compliance with the LGPD/GDPR laws. To be compliant with these laws now the Khan accepts a new environment variable `KHAN_SECURITY_ENCRYPTIONKEY` which should be a 32 byte length and will be used to encrypt the player name.





What was done


=======


* Create `security.encryptionKey` on app


* Refactor DAO to segmentize the player serialization field, in a way to concentrate the decryption logic in the `models/player.go`


* Add `util/secure.go` which will hold all encryption logic


* Add tests to `util/secure.go` in `util/secure_test.go`

The form submissions are working, but they are not making their way into the correct segments.





In another place I am using a radio button yes/no for GDPR consent, and that part is working correctly - they have a tag applied if they select yes, receive an email, and are unsubscribed/removed if they set no.

Perhaps this is an issue with how checkbox or multi-select options are being managed/processed by the form field value option in the campaign workflow?

### Steps to reproduce


1. Create a form with a multiselect option field


2. Create a campaign which has conditions based on the value of those fields


3. Add actions on the yes/no for them, so you can check if they are executed (eg change segment or add tag)


4. Fill form, check if the path has been followed","2021-05-13T15:49:27Z","2022-10-08T06:56:24Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

relationship between Art. 15(1) and (3) GDPR. Basically, those are the


two differing opinions:





1. The ""The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data


   undergoing processing."" from Art. 15(3) GDPR mandates how, in


   particular, to give the data subject ""access to the personal data""


   according to Art. 15(1) GDPR.





   As such, a request according to Art. 15(1) GDPR includes a request


   for a copy.


2. Art. 15(1) and (3) GDPR are separate rights. A data subject that


   wants a copy of their data explicitly has to request that according


   to Art. 15(3) GDPR.





We believe that by requesting ""all personal data concerning me that


you have stored"", as we did until now in our access template, it is


obvious that we are in fact requesting a copy of said data.


From countless access requests using our template that we have


submitted ourselves or have been told about by our users, we have also


not seen a single case where a controller interpreted our wording


differently.





However, a user recently kindly forwarded us a response from a data


protection authority to a complaint that did not provide a copy after


they requested access using our template. The authority ruled that it


was not clear from the request that the user in fact asked for a copy


and as such the controller acted correctly.





While we don't agree with the authority's assessment, one of our


primary goals with our request templates is to provide legal certainty


to our users.


As such, we have decided to change the access templates to explicitly


ask for a copy according to Art. 15(3) GDPR. This ensures that there


can be no more misunderstandings in the future and that our users have


a strong legal case for defending against controllers that don't


provide them with a copy of their data.





For reference, this is some of the literature on this topic (only in


German, unfortunately):

<b><font color=""#ef5350""> Name:  </font></b>  HTTP Authentication Scheme    <b><font color=""#ef5350""><sup>( 1 )</sup></font></b><br>
<br>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Overview: </strong> Authentication is the process of identifying whether a client is eligible to access a resource. The HTTP protocol supports authentication as a means of negotiating access to a secure resource.<br>
<br>
The general HTTP authentication framework is used by several authentication schemes. Schemes can differ in security strength and in their availability in client or server software. The server can specify multiple authentication schemes for the client to choose from. The most commonly used API Authentication schemes are <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Basic </li>
<li>API Key </li>
<li>OAuth or OAuth 2.0  </li>
</ul>
The ""Basic"" HTTP authentication scheme transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. As the user ID and password are passed over the network as clear text (it is base64 encoded, but base64 is a reversible encoding), the basic authentication scheme is not secure. HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication. Without these additional security enhancements, basic authentication should not be used to protect sensitive or valuable information.<br>
<br>
OAuth is the most widespread method used at it delivers a ton of benefits, from ease of use to a federated system module, and most importantly offers scalability of security.<br>
<br>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Severity: </strong>  Not having a secure Authentication Scheme can lead to expose of Sensitive Data and Sensitive Data Exposure is rated at 3rd position in 2017 OWASP Top 10.  <strong class=""text-danger""><sup>( 2 )</sup></strong><br>
<br>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Vulnerability Impact:  </strong>   Authentication mechanisms and schemes, if implemented incorrectly, may allow attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user's identities temporarily or permanently, compromising system's ability to identify the client/user and may compromise API security overall. The following are some of the consequences.<br>
<br> 
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary Data Exposure and Data theft.</li>
<li>Exposure of Clients data and Personal Identifiable Information.</li>
<li>Can be financially devastating to the organization.</li>
<li>Non-compliance to data regulations like EU GDPR or local privacy laws.</li>
</ul>
<strong class=""text-danger"">Remediation:  </strong>  The following may be employed to implement proper authentication scheme. <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication.</li>
<li>Classify data processed, stored or transmitted by an application. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.</li>
<li>Apply controls as per the classification.</li>
<li>Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and secure parameters. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).</li>
</ul>

## Description





Replaced peopleTable for users with proposalPeopleTable so that they cannot see the full user list. Now they can only see users that they have previously collaborated with as well as inviting existing users by email. 





I based the new component on the people table so it has some of the same code and structure.





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81559866/125451251-cdbafe73-04af-402c-9b52-4c3c37f91d9d.png)








## Motivation and Context





This solves this GDPR issue: https://github.com/UserOfficeProject/stfc-user-office-project/issues/146





## How Has This Been Tested





For the cypress tests, I have modified them to work on the new table. I then create a dummy proposal then log in as a user officer and edit the proposal from there to render a peopleTable so both tables are tested. 





## Changes





Created new component proposalsPeopleTable.tsx that is rendered when a user is creating a proposal. With this component, users can see users subset of the users that they have previously collaborated with or add an existing user by email. 





The new preivousCobaloraters query finds a user's most recent collaborators (the collaborators from the most recent proposal they worked on) as well as their 10 most collaborated with users.





The email box has some validation on it giving different error messages e.g. User is already on the proposal. It also renders a more detailed message if the email queried does not exist as this within our existing system as there are privacy settings possibly stopping a user from being found. This message may be something we could make site-specific if needed. 








We have also added some logic about who appears in add principal investigator/co-proposer lists based on if they are on the project already.





- If a user is on the proposal already as a principle investigator they will not appear in the lists


- If a user a co-proposer they will not be able to be added a co-proposer. 


- If a user is a co-proposer they can be 'elevated' to the principal investigator, this will remove them as a co-proposer and remove the current principal investigator from the proposal


- If a user removes someone as principal investigator they will become a co-proposer.


- A user cannot remove themselves as a co-proposer





There is now a partipantModel that renders peopleTable or proposalPeopleTable based on if the current userRole, if it, not a user officer, and if a new argument called participant (which is set in proposalParticipant(s) components) is set it renders the proposalPeopleTable else it renders peopleTable.





Created 2 new gql querys: getPreviousColaborators and getBasicUserDeatailsByEmail. 





## Possible Inprovments





Users that have been found by email could have some permeance within the list as currently they are lost when proposalPeopleTable is closed





This is my first time properly coding with react so if there is anything that can be improved around that please let me know. 





I am not sure where else this table might be used or if I have inadvertently placed it somewhere I should not.

The user manager also obfuscates the user's `UserAddress`es, but `pgcleanup.py` has always just removed those completely (even the non-GDPR version does this).





This tries to avoid changing anything that already exists since the PR is to stable (I'm calling this a bug since the script doesn't do the same thing that Galaxy does), a later dev PR should clean some stuff up:


- The separate handling to zero the `disk_usage` in the original `PurgeDeletedUsers` action seems unnecessary, in the GDPR query I just set it directly to 0 in the `UPDATE`. I assume I did this because I was mindlessly copying the way I did the usage recalculations for active users when purging HDAs?


- Only the first CTE query differs from the non-GDPR version, deduplication would be good (like `PurgesHDA`, but multiple inheritance makes that non-trivial).


- UI user purges are always GDPR-compliant currently, this script allows either, but maybe it should always do GDPR to be consistent with Galaxy. However I can imagine small lab servers not wanting the obfuscation.





## How to test the changes?


(Select all options that apply)


- [ ] I've included appropriate [automated tests](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/dev/writing_tests.html).


- [ ] This is a refactoring of components with existing test coverage.


- [x] Instructions for manual testing are as follows:


  1. Create a user


  2. Mark it deleted


  3. Run `pgcleanup.py -d --older-than 0 purge_deleted_users_gdpr`


  4. Observe that the user's `email` and `username` columns are now SHA1 hashes.


  2. We should probably add some tests for this, especially since it deletes stuff...

### How are you deploying your application?

### Describe the Bug

On the first page load of https://chatbooks.com in Safari (both on macOS and on iOS devices (tried on iPad, iPhone, iPad Pro), and ONLY the first page load, the page is rendered with empty containers.





![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2243596/129984997-3b9715c4-76fd-45fb-8130-d312e1c404e8.png)





Looking at the Dev Tools, all of the HTML elements are showing up, including the text/images that should be populating those boxes (the pink bar at the bottom is a GDPR banner, for instance), and all of the elements are interactive. If you hover over a navbar link, the highlight will show and if you click on it, the animation of a panel with a drop shadow is visible, but that panel has no text or images in it.





This ONLY happens on the first load with a clean Browser History. As soon as the page is reloaded once, it loads perfectly every time until the history is cleared (cache, etc.). This also only happens in Safari. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera even all render perfectly. Even IE renders it ugly, but at least the contents are there...

### Expected Behavior

The contents of the page should be displayed on first load.

### To Reproduce

Having never visited https://chatbooks.com, visit in a Safari browser. It's not 100% reproducible, but at least 75% of the time it will load with no contents. Refresh the browser to see the contents of the page load properly.





To eliminate domain issues, you can also visit https://chatbooks.vercel.app and the same thing happens.","2021-08-18T23:33:53Z","2021-11-05T16:50:03Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

Please describe.**


At the time being there is no unique identifier of registered timeseries entries. This  may simplify some queries, and help to support some of the ngsi-ld requirements.





From NGSI-LD spec for Properties:


* ""instanceId"": a URI uniquely identifying a Property instance. System generated. Optional.





For temporal representations, systems should maintain an instanceId for each Property instance. Without


such an instanceId, it is not possible to selectively modify or delete temporal information via the


NGSI-LD API. The consequences of this may be severe in the case of modification or deletion requests


for legal reasons, e.g. GDPR [i.18]. When implementing the NGSI-LD API on storage systems that do


NOT allow modification or deletion, similar problems may be encountered.








**Describe the solution you'd like**


1. When a new entity is received, automatically and id is generated from the backend db.

# Notes on data fetching and loading





## OSM API





It is possible doing aggregated quality analysis by using OSM API, but only on small areas.





## Overpass API





Overpass API is able to return large areas (like a whole city), but information about the individual nodes should be fetch over multiple OSM API calls, which seems not feasible due to bad performances.





## OSM planet full history





The planet file containing the history cannot be accessed directly as a regular database, because it has no index. It could be interesting to access to it as a Torrent, requesting only the blocks that are needed (there are some proof-of-concept sqlite databases served over torrent), but a spatial index should be generated first and various custom methods to access to the PBF data should be developed, to avoid conversion and import into a regular database, which would use even more space and resources.





## Ohsome





Ohsome [does not support](https://github.com/GIScience/ohsome-api/issues/197) contributors analysis we are doing at the moment, while Overpass API has even [more limited support](https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/issues/2) for temporal analysis.





Ohsome provides a fullHistoryBox API which provided mixed results; it seems that it is more convenient not to split the areas in too many subgroups and limit the number of concurrent requests. At the moment, it seems the only viable solution to do such kind of analysis, without having to store and keep synchronized the whole OSM history. It cannot be used to return the list of the unique usernames or user IDs. This is done on purpose: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/8/88/GDPR_Position_Paper.pdf.





Ohsome support has been recently merged: https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/pull/138. A caching mechanism should follow to further improve performances





# Notes on data rendering/serving





## TMS raster





Data could be rendered as a raster and served as a silly map layer over TMS. This would require the server to apply colors in advance, which can be problematic, as tiles would be rendered in parallel, without knowing the minimum nor the maximum over a given area. That would require some sort of user interaction to set the more appropriate scale while setting some reasonable defaults.





## Leaflet.markercluster





Points could be aggregated in clusters represented by a bigger point. This is the most promising solution at the moment, beign explored by this PR https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/pull/145.","2021-08-29T15:32:28Z","2021-10-04T18:11:20Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

[Security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security) Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a type of software that gathers log data and real-time event data generated from systems throughout an organization?s technology infrastructure and turns it into actionable information. Important uses of SIEM tools include alerting [security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security) staff about immediate [security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security) issues that need to be dealt with, and automated monitoring for compliance with important regulations such as HIPAA, PCI/DSS, and GDPR.

Among the systems that a SIEM solution collates data from are antivirus software, firewalls, host systems, database servers, web filters, network switches, and more. The SIEM tool takes all this information and aggregates it for a broad end-to-end view. The software then analyzes the aggregate data to find patterns and correlations and provide reports on [security](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Security)-related incidents and events.

### **Best Practices**

- Establish requirements to get a well-defined picture of the requirements for your SIEM deployment, including objectives, prioritized targets from those objectives, and the overall workflow.
- Collect as much diverse data as possible. More information is better when it comes to feeding data into a SIEM system because the essential role of these tools is to take a bunch of log and event data and answer meaningful questions from it. But those questions can't be answered without sufficient data.
- Have a comprehensive incident response plan.

In order to keep this backwards compatible, `__init__.py` is just


`from .rexport import *`, so this should work with anything using `my/reddit.py`


currently. If someone wants gdpr/pushshift, they have to opt in by changing imports


to `from my.reddit.all` and updating their config. In the future (once promnesia has supported


`my.reddit.all` for a while, probably a few months at least), the `__init__.py` can be removed

This task appends the version metadata to the file in the package index repository which corresponds to the crate.





We currently have another background worker task, `yank`, which gets called when a version is yanked (or unyanked). This tasks changes the `yanked` value in the version metadata in the package index repository.





Our background worker implementation (https://github.com/sgrif/swirl/) mostly runs tasks in order, but, due to built-in retry logic, that is not guaranteed. This means we could end up in a situation where the tasks are run in an order like: unyank, yank, yank, publish, unyank.





Instead of telling the background worker explicitly what action should be performed, it would be better to only tell it to update the package index repository according to the current state in the database.





We should implement a new `update_index(crate_name, version_num)` background worker task, that looks at the state of the index and of the database and then updates the index according to the current state of the database.





In a second step that background worker tasks should ideally then also handle the cases where versions (or even crates) are completely removed from the database due to e.g. GDPR requests.","2021-11-13T15:42:44Z","2021-12-20T14:20:42Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

- [X] I've read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and wholeheartedly agree





### I want to suggest an idea and checked that ...





- [X] ... to my best knowledge, my idea wouldn't break something for other users


- [X] ... the documentation does not mention anything about my idea


- [X] ... there are no open or closed issues that are related to my idea





### Description





First of all, I really like the [cookie consent feature](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-site-analytics/?h=consent#cookie-consent) of the insiders project and of course the whole project itself!





As discussed with Waldemar, ""Google Analytics"" is pre-selected in the cookie settings and hidden when not clicking the ""Manage settings"" button. 


I'm not a GDPR expert, but regarding a [summary of the ""Planet49""-judgement](https://www.oppenhoff.eu/de/news-detail/planet49-urteil-des-bgh-keine-wirksame-einwilligung-zu-cookies-durch-voreingestelltes-opt-in) pre-selected cookies which are not technically required are invalid.


It's stated in the last section under ""Was bedeuten diese Entwicklungen für die Praxis?""





Thus, it would be nice to add the ""checked"" flag as a variable to the mkdocs-config file as part of the cookie consent section, including a minor change of the current config although it is not backward compatible:





```yaml


extra:


  consent:


    cookies:


      analytics:


        checked: true 


        name: Custom name


```





### Use Cases





Changing the config in the described way would also make sure to pre-select individual cookies when further cookies will be added.

This PR modifies our YouTube embed component such that the `src` is only set after the user clicks a button to watch the video. With this, the embedded site has no way of breaking GDPR compliance through cookies, localStorage, or any other API because the site isn't even loaded until the user wants it to be. I assume we'll probably need to add a message like ""By playing this video you accept YouTube's cookies"" to be truly GDPR compliant.





We'll have to add our own background images if we want them, but that shouldn't be too difficult given that we can just grab youtube's image and display it on the element- just not as easy to work with should we change the video in the future.","2021-12-28T18:16:34Z","2022-01-17T20:43:11Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

I feel like I put it in kind of an awkward place... lmk if you can think of a better location for this message 😅  Maybe upon instantiation of the client even? Or just logged?

"https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/371",1101841882,10,1,"1","Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency, right to information","Law information page/policy","Law information page/policy","Law information page/policy","Both attributes (ABAC) and capabilities (CBAC) SHOULD be supported","At the moment, a client is able to request with a fine degree a precision a specific set of rights that should be included into an access token. However, a client is unable to request a specific set of attributes that should be included into an access token. 





As a consequence, the support of rights versus the support of attributes is unbalanced.





Implicitly, the core draft mandates a bilateral pre-relationship between every pair of AS / RS. This is not advertised in the draft.





Such bilateral pre-relationship limits the scalability of the architecture. When attributes only are supported, no bilateral pre-relationship between an AS and a RS is necessary.





The core document implicitly only allows an AS to add attributes into an access token at its own discretion, without any specific request for them to be included from the client (and hence the end-user).





This means that the core document does not allow an AS to add specific attributes into an access token upon the request from the client (and hence from the end-user).





This has severe consequences in term of the end-user privacy which are not mentioned in the draft.





First of all, since rights are always included, this means that the AS MUST be aware of the identity of the RS. In addition, the AS cannot be kept ignorant of which actions will be performed by a client and on which resources. **_This allows the AS to act as ""Big Brother""._** However, this can be prevented in the case where attributes only are supported.





Secondly, in order to support ""good practices"" (**_User Notice, User Choice, User Consent and Transparency_**) or legislation like the EU GDPR, the end-user should be informed about the set of attributes that are requested by a RS and should also be able to know the treatment(s) that will be done with such attributes. At the moment, a dialogue between the client and the RS is missing. A specific RS end-point should be defined and dedicated for such dialogue.





If the end-user agrees to provide that set of attributes to the RS, he should be able to indicate to the AS which attributes types (and optionally values) should be included into the access token. At the moment, the client is unable to specify to the AS a set of attributes to be included into the access token. In addition, an end-user is even unable to know which set of attributes are known by the AS.





If this situation is going to last, the privacy consideration section should clearly indicate these limitations.

Implement fixed height at `lg` breakpoint. For smaller breakpoints, flex container grows with content:

Current PHAR distribution of gdpr-dump (Version 2.3.0) errors on PHP 8.1. This **DOES NOT** happen when installing gdpr-dump from git (and do a fresh `composer install`). I guess it's related to the version of `symfony/console` shipped in the PHAR.





Edit: Okay, it's not the version of `symfony/console`. The error occurs due to the way gdpr-dump PHAR build works. The `Compiler` class uses `php_strip_whitespace` to strip all the comments from source code, which eliminates the `#[\ReturnTypeWillChange]` attribute.

## Motivation and context


As the brainlife platform moves towards engaging clinical researchers and/or groups using non-open (or otherwise protected) datasets, it may be worthwhile to begin exploring how to transfer / query / verify institutional permissions for accessing particular datasets. 





Currently, as I recall it, access to a dataset / project is managed by the admin of that project.  Beyond that protocol though, there aren't really any guardrails in place to constrain their activities as admin.  In this way they are at their liberty to add other users to the project / dataset as they see fit.  Particularly for open datasets this is ideal and allows for nimble development and analysis in a project.  However, for projects potentially involving clinical or other protected data, this setup may be too permissive.  As such, it may be worthwhile to look in to how to import certifications from third parties, as a means of controlling or compartmentalizing access to components of a dataset / project.





## Outline of approach





Currently there are a number of regulatory protocols and certifications  for research and data practices, including (among **many**):





- The [Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)](https://about.citiprogram.org/) program


- The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html)


- [Various institutional regulations (e.g. Institutional Review Boards (IRB) or other institutional protocols; [UT Austin](https://security.utexas.edu/policies/sensitive_research)]





In may cases the required trainings for these certifications are served or managed by online platforms like [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) or [CITI](https://about.citiprogram.org/), and are digitally transferred and recorded by consumer institutions.  Given that there appear to be systems in place to **digitally and automatedly** manage and administrate these certifications it seems that it may be quite technically feasible to incorporate these in the brainlife ecosystem.





### Foreseen challenges





#### Lack of obvious APIs


A quick check of CITI reveals [this page](https://webservices.citiprogram.org/), which provides some documentation of some forthcoming tools and methods which could facilitate this process.  Beyond this there doesn't appear to be much in the way of per-packaged approaches to this.





#### Lack of central protocol


While it is true that many institutions appear to be using the same internal methods for serving and documenting training compliance (i.e. Canvas), it's not clear that there is any standardization of these internal records that would permit the coordination, transfer, or updating of such information with 3rd parties (i.e. brainlife). 





#### Lack of standard certification 


Although federal and state regulations require that research institutions ensure and maintain compliance with ethical / security / procedural regulations, the specific means by which this is implemented aren't explicitly dictated or standardized.  As such institutions (and their respective IRBs) are at their discretion insofar as how they actually do this.  This means that different organizations, even in the same state or perhaps even in the same institutional system, may have different standards and methods for establishing and assessing certification.





##### Certification standardization sidenote


There's reason to believe that this ""wild west"" approach may be drawing to a close.  Europe's [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) is indicative to a more centralized and top-down approach to data security and compliance.  The existence of a standard like this would seem to permit the subsequent development of standardized certification procedures / protocols.  In the US there is [an ongoing push for data protection standards of this sort](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/), (also described [here](https://iapp.org/news/a/federal-data-privacy-regulation-is-on-the-way-thats-a-good-thing/)), which could similarly lay the groundwork for a standardized certification criterion.  Legislation of this sort will likely take several more years, but it may be worthwhile to be an early-adopter / path-forger in this domain.





## Tentative proposal 


Given that the scope (in that the infrastructure likely needed is non-trivial) and impact (in that such capabilities would be useful to other groups like [datalad](https://www.datalad.org/), [OpenNEURO](https://openneuro.org/), etc), it may be more appropriate to pursue this as part of a consortium or larger grant proposal (like this expired(?) [NIH Request for information](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-157.html)). In such a case it would probably be advisable to narrow the scope of this to the domain of neuromingaging data even though the methods/protocols developed would likely be easily adapted for other contexts. 





## Future extension


A similar process may also be appropriate for documenting / certifying the security and access characteristics of [compute resources](https://brainlife.io/resources).  Indeed, this may actually be a more tractable possibility, as the (currently( limited number of these systems would likely allow us to manually curate and codify these properties.","2022-03-10T18:14:55Z","2022-03-10T21:09:50Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

I needed to add GDPR accept cookie, [standard official implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/gdpr?view=aspnetcore-6.0).





Using:





- NET 6.0


- Piranha 10.0.2 (every package)


- Firefox 98.0.1


- Edge 99.0.1150.46


- Brave 1.36.119 Chromium: 99.0.4844.83





When I go to the website, I can click accept GDPR cookie, it shows up in browser's cookie list with accepted status. Working as intended.





When I go to the manager, I can log in, read, open everything. But every POST inside the manager returns `400 bad request`. Removing the GDPR cookie config from Startup fixes the issue.





```C#


options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.Unspecified;


Edge: works


Brave: bad request


Firefox: bad request


```


all other options, including `options.HttpOnly =  HttpOnlyPolicy.None` and `options.Secure = CookieSecurePolicy.Always` or any mix or other modes of the three don't work at all.





Log from Edge:


```


       POST https://localhost:5001/manager/api/page/save 400


saveInternal @ piranha.pageedit.min.js:1

```





Noticed the issue https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core/issues/1829, but I'm using the latest Piranha.





## Steps to reproduce:





1. dotnet new piranha.razor


2. add to `ConfigureServices`


```C#


            services.Configure<CookiePolicyOptions>(options =>


            {


                // Sets the display of the Cookie Consent banner (/Pages/Shared/_CookieConsentPartial.cshtml).


                // This lambda determines whether user consent for non-essential cookies is needed for a given request.


                options.CheckConsentNeeded = context => true;


                options.MinimumSameSitePolicy = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode.Strict;


            });


```


add `UseCookiePolicy()` to `Configure`


```C#


            // Configure Tiny MCE


            EditorConfig.FromFile(""editorconfig.json"");





            app.UseCookiePolicy();





            // Middleware setup


            app.UsePiranha(options => {


                options.UseManager();


                options.UseTinyMCE();


                options.UseIdentity();


            });


```


3. Go to manager, try saving/publishing a page





it doesn't matter if the GDPR cookie is accepted, since the manager should be marked essential Piranha 10.0.1 and newer?


I feel like I'm missing something obvious... Do I need to add it via `options.Services.AddCookiePolicy` and `options.Builder.UseCookiePolicy().Build()` or something now?





Interestingly, an older .NET Core 3.1 and Piranha 8.3.1 project with UseCookiePolicy() works without issue.","2022-03-22T16:58:01Z","2022-03-24T04:59:15Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

When a user soft-deletes themselves their name is not deleted from the database. This is not GDPR compliant





### Describe the solution you'd like





Content by a given user remains, but their name is removed from it. All personal data (email address etc) is deleted from the database.

# Purpose





Add MASKING_STRICT param. By default this is True, but if False, we can use a GDPR delete request, or a DELETE request if no UPDATE request is configured.





# Changes





-  When `SaaSConnector.mask_data` is called, we instantiate the `query_config` for the given Node and pull the masking request from that node's config, escalating to GDPR Delete or Delete if necessary.  Previously, we would just pull the `update` method by default in `SaaSQueryConfig.generate_update_stmt`


  - Error thrown if primary_key is defined on collection, but no masking request is configured. 


- Allow a `data_protection_request` to be configured on a SaaSConfig - this can potentially be called multiple times, limiting this is out of scope.  To constrain to just one collection, only define a primary_key on one collection for GDPR delete.

Bug / Question





## Description


Until version 6.18.0 it was possible to set a static GDPR Consent like documentated here (https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/modules/consentManagement.html -> Example 2: Static CMP using custom data passing.) and the Prebid.JS requests includes the provided consentString. With Version >= 6.19.0 this behavior changed.





Until 6.18.0 setting the static GDPR Consent like this:





let tcStr = 'CO4EXq8O4EYOWADABCDEAxCsAP_AAH_AAAAAGStV_T9fb2vj-_599_t0eY1f9_63t-wzhheMs-8NyZeX_J4Wv2MyvB34JqQKGRgkunLBAQdtHGncTQgBwIlViTLMYk2MjzNKJrJEmlsbO2dYGH9Pn8XT_ZKZ70-vv__7v3___33_4GSEEmCpfAQJCWMBJNmlUKIEIVxIVAOASghGEg0sNCRQU7I4CPUACABAYAIQIAQAgohJBAAIAAElEQAgAwIBEARAIAAQAjQEIACJAEFgBIGAQACoGhYARRBKBIQYHBUcogQFSLRQTwCQgAAMAAEAABQAAYAAHAACAAAkAAKAAA.YAAAAAAAAAA'





var pbjs = pbjs || {};


pbjs.que = pbjs.que || [];


pbjs.que.push(function() {


    pbjs.setConfig({


        priceGranularity: ""high"", 


        consentManagement: {


            gdpr: {


                cmpApi: 'static',


                consentData: {


                    getTCData: {


                        tcString: tcStr,


                        gdprApplies: true,


                        purpose: {


                            consents: {


                                1: true,


                                2: true,


                                3: true,


                                4: true,


                                5: true,


                                6: true,


                                7: true,


                                8: true,


                                9: true,


                                10: true


                            }


                        }


                    }


                }


            }


        }


    });


});





has the impact that a Prebid.JS bid requests includes:





`{


  ......


  ""gdprConsent"": {


    ""consentString"": ""CO4EXq8O4EYOWADABCDEAxCsAP_AAH_AAAAAGStV_T9fb2vj-_599_t0eY1f9_63t-wzhheMs-8NyZeX_J4Wv2MyvB34JqQKGRgkunLBAQdtHGncTQgBwIlViTLMYk2MjzNKJrJEmlsbO2dYGH9Pn8XT_ZKZ70-vv__7v3___33_4GSEEmCpfAQJCWMBJNmlUKIEIVxIVAOASghGEg0sNCRQU7I4CPUACABAYAIQIAQAgohJBAAIAAElEQAgAwIBEARAIAAQAjQEIACJAEFgBIGAQACoGhYARRBKBIQYHBUcogQFSLRQTwCQgAAMAAEAABQAAYAAHAACAAAkAAKAAA.YAAAAAAAAAA"",


    ""consentRequired"": true


  },


  ......


}`





After updating to a version >= 6.19.0 the Prebid.JS request do not include the consentString any more.


The request looks now like this:


`{


  ......


  ""gdprConsent"": {


    ""consentRequired"": false


  },


  ......


}`








Up to now i do not find a way to fix this. Would be cool if you can help me to get it work again.


Because we need it for our automatic tests.","2022-04-20T14:57:54Z","2022-04-20T18:11:47Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

## Description


It came up in [this PR](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/17538#discussion_r864598236) that we're titlizing the sidebar navigation items, and hence ""GDPR delete requests"".titleize will result in ""Gdpr Delete Requests"". 





Hence, we want to create an inflection for the GDPR Delete Requests and amend the class names in the files as per this rule.

    -   [x] Manually add any repository dependencies (if you can't add manually, refer [here](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/cg/features/cgmanifest/)). Only add a cgmanifest.json if the components are not NPM or are not dev only.


-   [x] Create new release branch with format `release/release-YYYY.MM.100`


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `release/release-YYYY.MM` for changes


    -   [x] Run `npm install` to verify `package-lock.json` did not get updated.


    -   [x] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


        -   [x] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/tree/main/news) (typically `python news --final --update CHANGELOG.md | code-insiders -`)


        -   [x] Copy over the ""Thanks"" section from the previous release into the ""Thanks"" section for the new release


        -   [x] Make sure the ""Thanks"" section is up-to-date (e.g. compare to versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/requirements.txt))


        -   [x] Touch up news entries (e.g. add missing periods)


        -   [x] Check the Markdown rendering to make sure everything looks good


    -   [x] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) as appropriate. This file is manually edited so you can check with the teams if anything needs to be added here.


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `release/release-YYYY.MM`


-   [x] Update the [`release` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/branches)


    -   [x] If there are `release` branches that are two versions old (e.g. release-2020.[current month - 2]) you can delete them at this time (you would have to un-protect the release branches temporarily to delete them).


-   [x] Update `main` after creating the release branch. (Warning: this should happen right after creating the release branch. If this is deferred till later, the `main` and `release` branches can diverge significantly, which may cause merge conflicts.)


    -   [x] Merge the changes from release (Changelog, delete news, ThirdPartyNotices) into `main` branch


    -   [x] Bump the version number to the next monthly (""YYYY.M.100"") release in the `main` branch


        - If latest is `2022.2.100`, them bump it to `2022.3.100`,


        - This ensures the new new pre-release targets the next version.


        -   [x] `package.json`


        -   [x] `package-lock.json`


        -   [x] Confirm the 3rd part of the version ends with `100`.


    -   [x] Update the VS Code engine version in package.json (for release version) to target the upcoming stable release. This will allow us to release before VS Code and be ready in the marketplace. [Example](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/pull/9494/files)


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `main`


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `main`


-   [x] GDPR bookkeeping (@greazer) (🤖; Notes in OneNote under Python VS Code -> Dev Process -> GDPR)


-   [x] Open appropriate [documentation issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apython)


    -   new features


    -   settings changes


    -   etc. (ask the team)


-   [x] Release notes from VS Code have something about Jupyter


    -   Example doc update [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/5256)


-   [x] Schedule a sanity test. Aim for close after freeze so there is still time to fix release bugs before release. Ask teams before bash for specific areas that need testing.


-   [x] Is the validation pipeline clear? If not, drive to make sure that it is clear for release. Sanity test can be used to help with this.


-   [x] Ask CTI to test the release candidate





# Testing (Monday of VS Code release week, XXX XX)





-  [x] Obtain VS Code [prebuild](https://builds.code.visualstudio.com/builds/stable) for sanity testing


-  [x] Sanity test release candidate VSIX against VS Code prebuild


   -   Make sure that the sanity test hits both macOS and Windows builds


-  [x] Candidate bug fixes found from sanity test should be checked into `main` and cherry-picked to `release` branch





# Release (Tuesday or day before VS Code publishes, whichever is later)





## Preparation





-   [x] Make sure the [appropriate pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls) for the release notes(https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/v<vscode version>.md, make note of the branch and file name).


    - [x] Include all new new features under a section named `Jupyter` with screenshots or animated gifs.


    - [x] Fixes, code health should remain in the Jupyter change log.


-   [x] Make sure [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_componentGovernance/191876) is happy


-   [x] Make sure there is nothing targeting this release that still needs to be validated


        (`is:issue sort:updated-desc milestone:""<milestone>"" label:verification-needed -label:verified`)





## Release





-   [x] Publish the release


    -   [x] Verify the PR Pipeline on Github actions is green against the release branch.


    -   [x] Manually run the [Stable pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_build?definitionId=284) against the `release/release-xxxx.xx` branch


    -   [x] Approve the `Publish` stage

# Day of VS Code publishing (Wednesday, XXX XX)


-   [x] Go through [`info needed` issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3Ainfo-needed) and close any that have no activity for over a month (🤖)


-   [x] GDPR bookkeeping (🤖) ((@greazer does regular classification every Monday evening))


-   [x] If any steps were unclear or changed in this release plan please update the `release_plan.md` file to make it clear for the next release

### Blindsend


<!--- Replace what's between ""<"" and "">"" --->


* [Blindsend](https://github.com/blindnet-io/blindsend) - Open source tool for private, end-to-end encrypted file exchange.


* **License**: MIT Licence


* **Why do you think this helps users privacy?**: Many users still use e-mail or non-encrypted file-transfer services to exchange sensitive (and often confidential) files. Even professionals (lawyers, doctors) request personal and sensitive data from their clients to be sent by e-mail. Blindsend encrypts files in the browser, before they reach the internet. It is easy to use, even for non-technical users. The parties exchanging files can remain anonimous.


* **Under what section should this service be listed?**: File Management and Sharing


* **Additional comments / info**: In the EU, thanks to the [Article 32 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/) it is illegal for professionals (such as lawyers, doctors, etc.) to request sensitive personal information to be sent to them in non-secure ways (such as e-mail). In France, failure to comply with this obligation can get professionals fined up to 300.000 EUR and 5 years of jail time, see [Art. 226-17 of French Criminal law](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/les-sanctions-penales).





So it is very important for professionals in EU to move away from e-mail and wetransfer, and adopt services listed here. Blindsend is our contribution to making a step in the right direction.

## Description of change


This is a maintenance PR to update the Live Connect library. Changes in the library:


- serialize multi-value attributes sent to the identity resolution endpoint as repetitive URL query parameters instead of a single comma-separated URL query parameter (not used in Prebid yet)


- derive privacy parameters for called services from the GDPR settings

# Code4Me


Code4Me provides automatic intelligent code completion based on large pre-trained language models. Code4Me predicts statement (line) completion and is available for both PyCharm (also other JetBrains IDEs) and Visual Studio Code. The code suggestions from Code4Me can be recognised by the logo in the suggestion menu. Code4Me automatically triggers (on specific trigger characters) or the user can prompt it manually by pressing the keybind. The keybind differs per IDE:





- Jetbrains: **ALT + SHIFT + K**


- VSC: **CTRL + SPACE**





Code4Me does not hinder native auto completion or other extensions.





## Installation


The plugin is available on both marketplaces. You can download them by either clicking the link in your browser or looking up 'Code4Me' in the integrated marketplace of your IDE.





### JetBrains


The Code4Me plugin can be found in the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19200-code4me).





### VSC


The Code4Me plugin can be found in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Code4Me.code4me-plugin).





## Data Collection


The plugin works with a remote API in order to suggest autocompletions. After triggering the autocompletion (automatically or manually), the client's request is sent to the server. Running the ML-based model, the server returns a prediction in response to the client. The remote API requires a segment of the current document (close left context at the trigger point). This limited segment is sent to the backend server only for prediction and will not be stored on our server. 


For the purpose of evaluating the models' predictions, we only store the suggestion made by the ML-based models at each trigger point and compare it against the accepted prediction by users (collected after 30 seconds). 





The plugin does not collect personal data nor the segment sent. The plugin does collect the following data:





* Suggest autocompletion.


* Verification of the autocompletion.


  * The plugin tracks the line the code was inserted and sends that line to the server after 30 seconds.


* Inference time of completion.





Furthermore, Code4Me is in full compliance with the GDPR and all data is anonymous. The data collected will remain on the servers of TU Delft until the end of the study. By using Code4Me you give permission for the data collection.





## Source Code


The source code for the IDE plugins and the API webserver can be found at our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/code4me-me/code4me).","2022-05-30T11:52:25Z","2022-05-30T14:18:56Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

We have an alternative after-action flow used by some petition and signup pages. Instead of redirecting to a separate thanks page, it keeps users on the same page after signing, and asks them to share and then donate, eg.

https://act.350.org/sign/stop-jackdaw-gas-field-uk/
https://act.350.org/sign/custom_page_field_demo_petition/

Whether we use this flow or the standard thanks page is toggled by the custom page field ""After-action – Next Step""
https://act.350.org/admin/core/allowedpagefield/after_5Faction_5Fnext_5Fstep/change/

When users select a European country on the form, they are automatically shown GDPR opt-ins and asked to opt-in to receive emails if they don't already have a privacy record on file. 

Selecting a Y or N answer to these opt-in radio boxes should be required, so people have to choose an answer to whether they would like to receive followup emails from us. This is the case for petition and signup pages which uses the standard thanks page:

https://act.350.org/sign/custom_page_field_demo_petition_standard_thanks/
https://act.350.org/sign/banks-stop-funding-destruction-argentina/

![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22962348/172732616-b4c939eb-b357-4f98-871c-de80b6a7ea90.png)

The ""Please select an option above"" message is set in the language strings:
https://act.350.org/admin/core/language/1/change/
and it actually looks like the duplication is because we have 2 versions of this, `error_privacy:missing` and `error_privacy:required`  #349 

### Bug:

However in Chrome Version 102.0.5005.61 and Firefox and Safari on mac, this EN version of the page is validating the required Name and email fields ok, but not the Europe opt-ins. You can skip the opt-ins and scroll right on down:
https://act.350.org/sign/stop-jackdaw-gas-field-uk/

### Exceptions:
Opt-ins won't be shown for European users that are recognised and already have a privacy record, so when they are hidden they of course shouldn't be required
AK's handling of GDPR is documented here: https://act.350.org/docs/manual/guide/privacy.html?highlight=privacy.html

I also noticed another bug where when content blockers are allowed in Safari, the form won't submit at all, we just see a ""loading"" beach ball -  #346


### This will be done when:

- [x] On a petition or signup page using the Sign>share>donate flow eg.
https://act.350.org/sign/stop-jackdaw-gas-field-uk/
https://act.350.org/sign/custom_page_field_demo_petition/
users who see the GDPR opt-ins (ie. are in Europe and don't have a privacy record) are not be able to submit the form without selecting an answer to the opt-in questions, and see a ""Please select an option above."" message.","2022-06-08T22:13:15Z","2022-08-16T22:25:14Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

## 3 things that might take us down





1. Rate limit API requests. We're emailing people now. @rcmarron 


2. Session recordings taking us down. Let's cap # recordings/day @rcmarron 


3. Same problem, but events @kappa90 





## Retro: Status of Outcomes from Previous Sprint








1. Kick off the persons on events async migration on Cloud and get a self-hosted team to run it @macobo Status: 99% done on self-hosted, cloud-specific clickhouse issue blocking a few million events from being migrated


2. Targeting a 'no rush' 100% - If we identify opportunities to improve the EKS stack we will before switching over @hazzadous - Made a little of progress, events still not on EKS


4. Continue supporting our paying on prem customers (big companies & co) @fuziontech - We have a solid strategy on how to deal with this in future


6. EU Deployment plan (Project docs) @guidoiaquinti - Deprioritised to focus on other stuff


8. S3 Session Recording @rcmarron. Status: Considering a big pivot on this project. Moving to an s3 backed merge table. Looking promising and 50x simpler - still needs more validation. Huge + is that there’s no new services to maintain/scale. If we don’t go this route, the existing approach is functionally working, but it needs more work for scalability - would leak into the next sprint.


1. Feature flag @neilkakkar Local evaluation of feature flags on server libraries (Python,Go,Ruby,Node,PHP): https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/7115. Status: Decided to focus on getting one library perfect vs speed running. 3 down, 2 to go. 


1. Data Management Finalization + Recordings data management https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/10892 @alexkim205. Status: wrapped data management, recordings still in progress. Stuff pushed to next week


1.  We will have agreed on and tested the tooling and architecture of the design system. @benjackwhite 


  - A lot of tooling work done - new scss utilities work, eslint rules to push us toward the right solution, beginning of work on refined Storybook approach 





## Retro: What can we do better next sprint?








## Support hero this sprint


<!-- https://posthog.pagerduty.com/schedules#PPLGE4G -->


Week 1: Alex


Week 2: Ben





## Plan: Proposed Goals for Next Sprint 





Each goal should have a single owner. Owner can only be an engineer.





1. s3 backed recordings @rcmarron 


why: Make sure we can retain sessions + not blow up clickhouse


2. turbo mode wrap up @neilkakkar 


why: immediate evaluation of feature flags rather than waiting for /decide


3. Session Recordings Experience enhancement — Event list @alexkim205 


why: Better/more fine grained experience, more parity with events


4. Person on events rollout @EDsCODE 


why: make our much queries faster


5. Switch over events to EKS and set ECS to 0 - @guidoiaquinti 


why: infrastructure parity between self hosted and cloud


6. ""Right to be forgotten"" tooling - make deleting person/groups/teams data easy @macobo


Why: GDPR compliance is one of our strengths (for self-hosted) and person-on-events is closing completion - we need proper tooling to make sure we can delete data still without killing performance.


7. Implement ""fundamental"" Design System components @benjackwhite 


why: design system will help us move faster


8. Low hanging fruit for visualisations https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/11106 @Twixes 


why: Small fixes around visualisations will improve retention

I was first surprised to discover a cookie set by the Website `https://www.filbleu.fr/`


Cookie : `tarteaucitron`


Value : `!facebookpixel=wait!matomo=true!youtube=wait`


Installed via : `https://www.filbleu.fr/typo3conf/ext/tc_theme_site/Resources/Public/Dist/Javascript/vendors/tarteaucitron/tarteaucitron.js`





Cookie Value if the user chooses: '**OK, accept all**' : `!matomo=true!facebookpixel=true!youtube=true`


Cookie Value if the user chhoses '**Deny all cookies**' : `!facebookpixel=false!matomo=false!youtube=false`





This of course is initiated by the Website and I have contacted them to ask in what `facebookpixel` and `youtube` have anything to do with the site, given moreover that there is no connection to 3rd-party sites Facebook nor Youtube, no YouTube embedded video.





The point is : 


1- Many users may believe that denying all cookies will prevent them from logging in, **which is not true** : **refusing blocks only `facebookpixel` and `youtube`**


2- Without GDPR `facebookpixel` and `youtube` would have their cookies (provided 3-rd party cookies are not blocked) : so thank you GDPR


3- Thank you tarteaucitron for perfectly serving GDPR


4- A big slap to sites which consider installing cookies which have nothing to do with a correct rendering and efficiency.

For a GDPR documentation, I need to specify which cookies our applications creates and which personal user information they may contain.





Right now the application sets:


```


next-auth.session-token.1


next-auth.session-token.0


next-auth.callback-url


next-auth.csrf-token


```





I expect the following:


* `next-auth.session-token.0/1` contain the chunked return value of `callbacks.session` (https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#session-callback)


* `next-auth.callback-url` is just the encrypted callback-url and does not contain any user data


* `next-auth.csrf-token` - not sure. 





All cookie values are encrypted via `NEXT_AUTH_SECRET` as key.





Can I get the raw, decoded values of the cookies to look into them and check where personal user data might get stored?





Thanks! 








### How to reproduce ☕️





doesn't really apply to my question since it's too general :)

It is controlled by a cookie `pop_up_sciblog`, if there is no cookie, the opt-in is shown, and if the cookie is there, the opt-in form is not shown. 


See opt-in below:


<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3491412/199964453-4a9b63e4-eaf6-40e2-86a8-e655a721623b.png"" alt=""drawing"" width=""300""/>





The problem is that unless users filled up all the mandatory fields, the form doesn't work correctly. In particular, if a mandatory field is not filled up, the form sends you to an error page saying that a mandatory field was not added. When you go back to the home page, the cookie `pop_up_sciblog` is already created, so the opt-in won't appear again.





To solve the problem, I need to create a JS to show an error to users if they have not filled up the mandatory fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, and Marketing permission. I want the error to appear below each of the boxes in light red.

-   Python 3.7 and higher


-   run `python3 -m pip install --user -r news/requirements.txt`





# Get the build green (Early in endgame week)





- [x] Ensure that any CI test failures have issues assigned to that area's owner.


- [x] Drive the build to green by fixing/disabling tests or pinging area owners to do so.





# Move open issues (Tuesday of VS Code endgame week, XXX XX)





- [x] Ask the team to move all open issues to next milestone or remove milestone and put back in triage. This allows endgame champ to have a better understanding of done state.


- [x] Schedule a bugbash if needed.





# Release candidate (Friday of VS Code endgame week, XXX XX)





-   [x] Review [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_componentGovernance/191876) (Click on ""microsoft/vscode-jupyter"" on that page) and resolve all High/Severe issues.





    -   [x] Focus on resolving `Critical` and `High` priority issues as others will be addressed in the `debt` week.


    -   [x] Manually add any repository dependencies (if you can't add manually, refer [here](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/tools/cg/features/cgmanifest/)). Only add a cgmanifest.json if the components are not NPM or are not dev only.


        Instructions on updating `npm` dependencies in `package.json` & `package-lock.json` can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/wiki/Resolving-Component-Governance-and-Dependabot-issues-(updating-package-lock.json)).


-   [x] Create new release branch with format `release/release-YYYY.MM.100`


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `release/release-YYYY.MM.100` for changes


    -   [x] Bump the vscode engine version in package.json


    -   [x] Run `npm install` to verify `package-lock.json` did not get updated aside from the vscode engine version.


        -   If there are minor changes, they can be just be updated in the release branch and later ported back to main.


    -   [x] Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)


        -   [x] Run [`news`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/tree/main/news) (typically `python news --final --update CHANGELOG.md | code-insiders -`)


        -   [x] Update the date at the top to when the release is planned.


        -   [x] Copy over the ""Thanks"" section from the previous release into the ""Thanks"" section for the new release


        -   [ ] Make sure the ""Thanks"" section is up-to-date (e.g. compare to versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/requirements.txt))


        -   [x] Touch up news entries (e.g. add missing periods)


        -   [x] Check the Markdown rendering to make sure everything looks good


    -   [x] Update [`ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/ThirdPartyNotices-Repository.txt) as appropriate. This file is manually edited so you can check with the teams if anything needs to be added here.


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `release/release-YYYY.MM.100`


-   [x] Update the [`release` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/branches)


    -   [x] If there are `release` branches that are two versions old (e.g. `release-2020.[current month - 2].100`) you can delete them at this time (you would have to un-protect the release branches temporarily to delete them).


-   [x] Update `main` after creating the release branch. (Warning: this should happen right after creating the release branch. If this is deferred till later, the `main` and `release` branches can diverge significantly, which may cause merge conflicts.)


    -   [x] Merge the changes from release (Changelog, delete news, ThirdPartyNotices) into `main` branch


    -   [x] Bump the version number to the next monthly (""YYYY.M.100"") release in the `main` branch


        - If latest is `2022.2.100`, them bump it to `2022.3.100`,


        - This ensures the new new pre-release targets the next version.


        -   [x] `package.json`


        -   [x] `package-lock.json`


        -   [x] Confirm the 3rd part of the version ends with `100`.


    -   [x] Create a pull request against `main`


    -   [x] Merge pull request into `main`


-   [x] GDPR bookkeeping (🤖)


    - https://gdpr.datasmart.ms/ search `EntityName like 'ms-toolsai.jupyter/%' and complete = 'false'`


    - Typically just update columns DataClassification, BusinessJustification, InteralOnly, Suppressed, Retired


        - Suspected PII requires more


-   [ ] Open appropriate [documentation issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apython)


    -   new features


    -   settings changes


    -   etc. (ask the team)


-   [ ] Release notes from VS Code have something about Jupyter


    -   Example doc update [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/5256)


-   [ ] Schedule a sanity test. Aim for close after freeze so there is still time to fix release bugs before release. Ask teams before bash for specific areas that need testing.


-   [x] Ensure that closed issues targeting this release will be verfied, asking for verification steps if needed. Sanity test can be used to help with this.


    -   `is:issue sort:updated-desc milestone:""<milestone>"" label:verification-needed -label:verified`


-   [ ] Ask CTI (Python Tools CTI) to test the release candidate


    -   Test plan document: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/blob/main/.github/test_plan.md





# Testing (Monday of VS Code release week, XXX XX)

-  [ ] Sanity test release candidate VSIX against VS Code prebuild


   -   Make sure that the sanity test hits both macOS and Windows builds


-  [ ] Candidate bug fixes found from sanity test should be checked into `main` and cherry-picked to `release` branch





# Release (Tuesday or day before VS Code publishes, whichever is later)





## Preparation





-   [ ] Make sure the [appropriate pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pulls) for the release notes(https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/vnext/release-notes/v<vscode version>.md, make note of the branch and file name).


    - [ ] Include all new new features under a section named `Jupyter` with screenshots or animated gifs.


    - [ ] Fixes, code health should remain in the Jupyter change log.


-   [ ] Make sure [Component Governance](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_componentGovernance/191876) is happy


-   [ ] Make sure there is nothing targeting this release that still needs to be validated


        (`is:issue sort:updated-desc milestone:""<milestone>"" label:verification-needed -label:verified`)





## Release





-   [ ] Publish the release


    -   [ ] Verify the PR Pipeline on Github actions is green against the release branch.


    -   [ ] Manually run the [Stable pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/monacotools/Monaco/_build?definitionId=284) against the `release/release-YYYY.MM.100` branch


    -   [ ] Approve the `Publish` stage


    -   [ ] Check if the release was automatically published here, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases - If not, publish manually: (This has been required since the move to az pipelines)


        -   [ ] Add a new release at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/releases


            -   Tag is version number


            -   Branch is release branch


            -   Copy contents of release branch changelog into the release (just copy the markdown)


        -   [ ] Publish


-   [ ] Determine if a hotfix is needed


    -   [ ] Ensure the version in package.json is updated as follows:


        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.100`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.110`


        * If released version is `YYYY.MM.110`, then hot fix will be `YYYY.MM.120`





# Day of VS Code publishing (Wednesday, XXX XX)


-   [ ] Go through [`info needed` issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3Ainfo-needed) and close any that have no activity for over a month (🤖)


-   [ ] GDPR bookkeeping (🤖)


-   [ ] If any steps were unclear or changed in this release plan please update the `release_plan.md` file to make it clear for the next release





# Day of VS Code releasing the next insider version (Wednesday, XXX XX)


-   [ ] Bump the engines.vscode version on the `main` branch to point to the next insider version. For example, from `1.58.0-insider` to `1.59.0-insider`

- [X] I have searched for similar issues in both open and closed tickets and cannot find a duplicate.


- [X] The issue still exists against the latest stable version of Elementor.





### Description





It seems Elementor is loading a Google Font in the Wordpress backend:


`<link rel='stylesheet' id='elementor-admin-top-bar-fonts-css'  href='[https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&#038;display=swap&#038;ver=3.7.8](view-source:https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap&ver=3.7.8)' media='all' />`





a) This is unnecessary – the WP backend already has a font.


b) Just loading Google Fonts is not GDPR compliant.


c) It is loaded even on non-Elementor pages!





### Steps to reproduce





Install Elementor. Look at backend HTML output.





### Isolating the problem





- [X] This bug happens with only Elementor plugin active (and Elementor Pro).


- [X] This bug happens with a Blank WordPress theme active ([Hello theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/)).


- [X] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.





### System Info





Wordpress 6.0.1

Matomo currently supports the Do-Not-Track-Header that was introduced by some browser years ago. The option to exclude visitors sending this header is even enabled by default.





In 2019 W3C closed the group that was working on the DNT standard and though this is meanwhile deprecated.





Safari [removed the support for DNT](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-12_1-release-notes#Security-and-Privacy) for privacy reasons shorty after that in version 12.1.





In matter of GDPR the DNT header does also not need to be respected.





We should there no longer enabled the DNT option by default in Matomo and add a useful information explaining why this feature now is deprecated and might be removed in an upcoming major release if more browsers drop the support.","2022-11-15T06:23:33Z","2023-02-10T01:30:25Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

This might be overkill, but it's at least worth an effort to investigate.





**This issue is related to issue #163**


It is also discussed on the Resonate Community board [here](https://community.resonate.coop/t/right-to-be-forgotten/2620).





TLDR:


1. Within the scope of Resonate's business operations, GDPR compliance can be considered ""common sense"" requirements. ""Common sense"", in this case, means the deletion of clearly identifying data, such as name / address / email , and so forth.


2. Data can be retained if it is of ""legitimate interest"" to Resonate (ie artist info / assets that have been purchased by other users of Resonate's platform, or similar circumstances where the retention of data supports Resonate's ongoing business operations).





This issue can be further defined if / when needed. Supporting information is provided in the next section, below.","2022-11-18T14:26:36Z","2022-12-18T06:03:37Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

That very likely means that Typlog's users (i.e., Typlog's customers) are in violation of the GDPR.





I found a reasonable explanation of the issue [here](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/gdpr-cookies/); here's a relevant sampling:





> The GDPR requires a website to only collect personal data from users after they have given their explicit consent to the specific purposes of its use.


>


> Websites must comply with the following GDPR cookie requirements:


>


> * Prior and explicit consent must be obtained before any activation of cookies (apart from whitelisted, necessary cookies).


> ...





California has vaguely similar rules that are described [here](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/what-is-ccpa/).





It's possible that the cookies are just an oversight, and Typlog doesn't actually need them at all. If that's true, they should be removed; there's nothing more to talk about! I suspect, however, that the cookies are needed for the built-in analytics. 





If that's the case, I think there are two broad options.





The first is that Typlog is able to make its analytics cookie-free; in that case, no consent is needed. (I guess? I don't know if there are other subtleties.)





The second is that Typlog isn't able to make its analytics cookie-free; in that case, Typlog would need to introduce a cookie consent mechanism.





Personally, I really, really, really hate cookie consent dialogs. I wouldn't want to use them on my site, so I'd strongly prefer a third option: the ability to turn off features that require them. (I'm specifically focusing on *anonymous* users here.)





Btw, for my own sites I generally use GDPR-aware analytics like [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io) that don't use cookies and don't require consent.","2022-11-19T22:10:10Z","2022-11-20T11:36:06Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

Fixes #2884 





- As discussed in Issue #2884, I added the [Data Privacy Handbook](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook) as a resource to the Resources subchapter of Managing Sensitive Data Projects.


- I also proposed some minor tweaks to two other subchapters in Managing Sensitive Data Projects.





### List of changes proposed in this PR (pull-request)





- Add Data Privacy Handbook to `project-design/sdpm/resources.md`


- Add more GDPR-like language to the `project-design/sdpm/informed.md` subchapter. The GDPR has some more specific requirements which are now a bit clearer.


- In the `project-design/sdpm/data-privacy-strategies.md`:


  - Removed the part that said ""while limiting the loss of information"": you always lose information when anonymising data


  - Expanded the Access permissions part and the part on Data transfer

- Add the Do Not Sell setting to the Privacy page (`/me/privacy/`)


  - Disable setting if cookie banner has not been yet accepted


  - Don't show the setting for non-CCPA regions 





#### Testing Instructions





* Checkout changes and run Calypso dev env


* Go to `calypso.localhost:3000/me/privacy?flags=cookie-banner`


* Set cookies for CCPA region: `country_code=US; region=California;`


* Set all buckets to accepted: `document.cookie = 'sensitive_pixel_options=%7B%22version%22%3A20201224%2C%22ok%22%3Atrue%2C%22buckets%22%3A%7B%22essential%22%3Atrue%2C%22analytics%22%3Atrue%2C%22advertising%22%3Atrue%7D%7D';`

* You should be able to switch Do Not Sell setting - it should impact `buckets.advertising` value in `sensitive_pixel_options` cookie


* Remove the `sensitive_pixel_options` cookie (stay in CCPA region)


* You should see Do Not Sell setting on Privacy page, but the switch should be disabled

## Description


GDPR payment regulations state that all businesses that collect/process personal data of customers from Europe need to comply with the regulatory requirements. GDPR protects customers’ privacy by empowering the customer with the ownership of their personal data and thereby enabling them to  dictate how their personal data should be handled by those who collected it


customer delete call also delete all the data associated with that customer

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe





<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->





Hi, I wanted to setup an analytics service. I found this blog post on how to set Google Page View.


https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/enable-google-pv/





This solution however requires the use of Google Analytics, which comes with the following terms and conditions on privacy.


I don't think jekyll or jekyll-theme-chirpy are complying with this policy by default. There is no cookie consent banner on the template. Nor there is a disclosure on the data collection and processing.





> You must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies, identifiers for mobile devices (e.g., Android Advertising Identifier or Advertising Identifier for iOS) or similar technology used to collect data. You must disclose the use of Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes data. This can be done by displaying a prominent link to the site “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps”, (located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), or any other URL that Google may provide from time to time). You will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a User is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the User’s device where such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law.


 


More info from [another source](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/privacy-policy-google-analytics/). 





> Google Analytics stores [cookies](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/cookies/) on your users' PCs to keep track of usage data. This is enough to evoke the requirement of a Privacy Policy according to the [EU Cookies Directive](https://termsfeed.com/blog/eu-cookies-directive/). The EU's [GDPR](https://termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr/) also requires a Privacy Policy when usage data is collected, such as through cookies.





This is the problem I have. I wish to use an analytics service while remaining compliant to their privacy terms :)





## Describe the solution you'd like





<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->





I would really like to be able to use a GDPR compliant analytics service. [This PostHog tool](https://posthog.com/) seems like a good alternative. With that (or with another GPDR compliant tool ([here is a list of 13 tools](https://posthog.com/blog/best-gdpr-compliant-analytics-tools))) there will be no need to integrate a cookie banner.





A blog post on how to configure the jekyll-theme-chirpy with one of these tools would be fantastic :rocket: 





## Describe alternatives you've considered





<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->





* If Google Analytics is to be used, then the cookie banner as well as the disclosure need be integrated in the template.


* Very basic but still can display views for each page: https://countapi.xyz/

## What Does This Do?


<!--


    Give a generalized summary of the changes made.


    IE: ""Moved the Selector Button Over for Desktop Users""


-->





Removes Google Fonts from the site as using Google Fonts means that the site is not EU GDPR compliant.





## How is it Done?


<!--


    Explain what you've done to get the results and fixes you made. More descriptive PRs


    are more likely to be accepted but do not provide a timeline of events or step by step instructions.





    IE:


    """"""


    Since there are reports of CSS overlap with the selector button, I've updated the CSS file for the component.


    I've verified that my changes worked for Chromium and Firefox browsers but have not tested the changes on mobile.


    """"""


-->





Saved the necessary font assets locally and use a new CSS file to use them throughout the site.

<!-- What problem does this solve? -->





GDPR api module was installed locally. This moves it to contrib modules.





Profile Backend calls this backend when user wants to get their GDPR api data.





## What was done


<!-- Describe what was done -->





* Removed from custom folder


* Added via composer.json








## How to install





* Make sure your instance is up and running on correct branch.


  * `git checkout UHF-0000_insert_correct_branch`


  * `make fresh`


* Run `make drush-cr`





## How to test


<!-- Describe steps how to test the features, add as many steps as you want to be tested -->





* [ ] This can be only tested with Postman and then we can't have proper JWT token as Helsinki profiili does not provide proper testing methods for this.


* [ ] When trying to access our https://hel-fi-drupal-grant-applications.docker.so/helfi-gdpr-api/endpoint/user-uuid endpoint you should see access denied in config.

-->

Closes Automattic/Martech#1681

## Proposed Changes

* We'd like to add more information to the Facebook/Meta tracking pixel, e.g. bill period.
* Removes the joined string of product_slugs, and instead adds them in an array. This makes it easier to ""pick up"" product slugs and other info in the Meta Ads Manager (hopefully).

## Testing Instructions
* Sandbox store
* Allow ad-tracking and allow advertising via the cookie banner (if you're in GDPR). E.g. by changing the config/development.json file, or adding `?flags=ad-tracking` to the URL.
* You can add a `debugger` statement inside the `containsWpcomProducts` conditonal in `recordOrderInFacebook`, and verify that the array get's populated, or just monitor in the network console. Once the payment is complete, you should see this data being sent to Facebook
* (We need to verify that the Facebook analytics panel is picking up this meta data). 

Expected data for a Business plan with a bundled domain:

BuildingID’s that are queried for the first time can currently be retrieved when one has access to the webservice. When new data becomes available on FunderMaps' side for a BuildingID that was previously queried by the client,  the client requesting the new data also.

For this purpose a registration needs to be maintained on FunderMaps' side.
Considerations are:

It is not possible with respect to contracts and GDPR to register customer's properties.
The customer needs to know which properties have received new data in some way. For example, by making a call that returns a list of properties that were previously requested but have new data. This list contains the BAG property ID, which the customer can use to query the webservice again. No insight is provided into what data has changed.

<!-- Put an `x` in the boxes that apply -->
- [x] New feature

## Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
This PR adds support for encrypting PII fields in following tables
- MerchantAccount
- MerchantConnectorAccount
- Address
- Customer

Here's how the basic flow goes, the main encryption key `master_key` will be encrypted with KMS and configured in `development.toml`. For every merchant we will create seperate encryption key and encrypt that key with `master_key` and push it to the database and we will use that key to encrypt the PII fields.

This PR also has migration script that will migrate currently decrypted database to encrypted database.

### Additional Changes
- [x] This PR modifies the database schema

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  

I was surprised to see that an open source project running locally as a demo was sending analytics data to Google.

**Describe the solution you'd like**  

`enable_analytics` should be an option that defaults to **do not track analytics**. A user should explicitly opt-into this behavior rather than have to opt out.

**Additional context**  

The opt-in default is implemented here:

https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/v3.30.0/gradio/blocks.py#L686-L687

Apart from the unconventional use of `True` as an environment variable to signal true/yes/on (it's more common to use `1`), environment variables should default to ""user did not specify this value"".

I think it's perfectly acceptable and to enable the collection of data by way of a public server (e.g. a hosted version of a gradio app) but it is not acceptable IMO to track data running locally without an explicit opt-in from the user.","2023-05-15T22:24:39Z","2024-05-16T04:31:56Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

Of course he could also use the acount to send SPAM mails.

I therefore was forced to create my own REST API utilizing tokens I can easily revoke that is called by the website. The service then actually calls the listmonk API. If the website is hacked the only thing the user can do is send opt-in mails and subscribe or unsubscribe e-mail addresses - he can't even get access to the full list of users as I didn't implement that method on purpose.

Therefore instead of adding multi-user support I'd rather see token authentication for the API as an additional way of authentication. That should be quite easy to implement.

We plan to migrate our authentication method from jwt in localstorage to session cookies authentication, in the purpose of api subdomain authentication, instead of front end subdomain authentication.
(one api subdomain can have multiple front end subdomains) .

Ex: 
Api subdomain (owner) :
`https://myclientApiSubdomain1.apidomain.com/`
can have multiple front end subdomains (entity) :  
`https://myClientFrontEndSubdomain1.clientdomain.com/`
`https://myClientFrontEndSubdomain2.clientdomain.com/`

Today, myClientFrontEndSubdomain1 does not share authentication with myClientFrontEndSubdomain2.

It's what we want to do and I know we can do it with session cookies.

Our javascript code is hosted on `https://myclientApiSubdomain1.apidomain.com/client/build/js/app.js`

There are one capacitor app per ""myClientFrontEndSubdomain"" which reference the javascript assets hosted remotely on the api server.


I have read lots of quirks about cookies not sent along http requests from capacitor.

My knownledge of capacitor is small, and my questions are :  

- Is there a way to send cookies along requests, working with our current codebase (axios requests)
- Does it require a specific plugin
- If a plugin is required, does it require specific ios capability(ies), like cookies consent (I believe no as authentication cookies does not require cookies consent in the scope of GDPR) ?

- If not possible, what other options do we have ?","2023-05-25T04:55:31Z","2024-03-15T19:48:36Z","GDPR","GDPR"

Having regard to Article 70(1)(n) and Articles 40 and 41 of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”),
Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018,
Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018,
HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION:
1 INTRODUCTION
1. Regulation 2016/6791 (“the GDPR”) came into effect on 25 May 2018. One of the main objectives of the GDPR is to provide a consistent level of data protection throughout the European Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market.2 The GDPR also introduces the principle of accountability, which places the onus on data controllers to be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation.3 The provisions under Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR in respect of codes of conduct (“codes”) represent a practical, potentially cost effective and meaningful method to achieve greater levels of consistency of protection for data protection rights. Codes can act as a mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.4 Notably, they can help to bridge the harmonisation gaps that may exist between Member States in their application of data protection law.5 They also provide an opportunity for particular sectors to reflect upon common data processing activities and to agree to bespoke and practical data protection rules, which will meet the needs of the sector as well as the requirements of the GDPR.6
1 The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.
2 See Recital 13 of the GDPR.
3 See Article 5(2) of the GDPR.
4 See for example Articles 24(3) and 28(5) and 32(3). A code of conduct may also be used by data processors to demonstrate sufficient guarantees that their processing is compliant with the GDPR (See Article 28(5)).
5 See Recitals 77, 81, 98, 99, 148, 168 and Articles 24, 28, 35, 40, 41, 46, 57, 64, 70 of the GDPR. This is particularly the case where a code relates to processing activities in several Member States.
6 Codes do not necessarily need to be confined or limited to a specific sector. For example, a code could apply to separate sectors who have a common processing activity which share the same processing characteristics and needs. Where a code is cross-sectoral in its application, more than one monitoring body may be appointed under that code. However, where this is the case the code should make it absolutely clear as to the scope of that monitoring body’s functions, in other words by specifying the sectors in respect of which each monitoring body will perform its functions under Article 41 and the oversight mechanisms available to each monitoring body. In this regard, the relevant sections of these guidelines which set out the responsibilities, obligations and
 **Adopted 5**

2. Member States, Supervisory Authorities, the European Data Protection Board (“the Board”) and the European Commission (“the Commission”) are obliged to encourage the drawing up of codes to contribute to the proper application of the Regulation.7 These guidelines will support and facilitate “code owners” in drafting, amending or extending codes.
1.1 Scope of these guidelines
3. The aim of these guidelines is to provide practical guidance and interpretative assistance in relation to the application of Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR. They are intended to help clarify the procedures and the rules involved in the submission, approval and publication of codes at both a National and European level. They intend to set out the minimum criteria required by a Competent Supervisory Authority (“CompSA”) before accepting to carry out an in depth review and evaluation of a code.8 Further, they intend to set out the factors relating to the content to be taken into account when evaluating whether a particular code provides and contributes to the proper and effective application9 of the GDPR. Finally, they intend to set out the requirements for the effective monitoring of compliance with a code.10
4. These guidelines should also act as a clear framework for all CompSAs, the Board and the Commission to evaluate codes in a consistent manner and to streamline the procedures involved in the assessment process. This framework should also provide greater transparency, ensuring that code owners who intend to seek approval for a code are fully conversant with the process and understand the formal requirements and the appropriate thresholds required for approval.
5. Guidance on codes of conduct as a tool for transfers of data as per Article 40(3) of the GDPR will be considered in separate guidelines to be issued by the EDPB.
6. All codes previously approved11 will need to be reviewed and re-evaluated in line with the requirements of the GDPR and then resubmitted for approval as per the requirements of Articles 40 and 41 and as per the procedures outlined in this document.
2 DEFINITIONS
‘Accreditation’ refers to the ascertainment that the proposed monitoring body meets the requirements set out in Article 41 of the GDPR to carry out the monitoring of compliance with a code of conduct. This check is undertaken by the supervisory authority where the code is
accreditation requirements in relation to monitoring bodies apply individually to each such monitoring body appointed under the code.
7 Article 40(1) of the GDPR.
8 See Article 40(5), Article 55(1) and Recital 122 of the GDPR.
9 See Article 40(1) and Recital 98 of the GDPR.
10 See for example Article 41(2) and 41(3) of the GDPR.
11 By either National Data Supervisory authorities or the Article 29 Working Party prior to the GDPR and these guidelines.
 **Adopted 6**

submitted for approval (Article 41(1)). The accreditation of a monitoring body applies only for a specific code.12
‘Code Owners’ refers to associations or other bodies who draw up and submit their code13 and they will have an appropriate legal status as required by the code and in line with national law. ‘CompSA’ refers to the Supervisory Authority which is competent as per Article 55 of the GDPR. ‘Monitoring body’ refers to a body/committee or a number of bodies/committees (internal or external to the code owners14) who carry out a monitoring function to ascertain and assure that the code is complied with as per Article 41.
‘Concerned SAs’ shall have the same meaning as per Article 4(22) of the GDPR
‘National code’ refers to a code which covers processing activities contained in one Member State. ‘Transnational code’ refers to a code which covers processing activities in more than one Member State.
3 WHATARECODES?
7. GDPR codes are voluntary accountability tools which set out specific data protection rules for categories of controllers and processors. They can be a useful and effective accountability tool, providing a detailed description of what is the most appropriate, legal and ethical set of behaviours of a sector. From a data protection viewpoint, codes can therefore operate as a rulebook for controllers and processors who design and implement GDPR compliant data processing activities which give operational meaning to the principles of data protection set out in European and National law.
8. Trade associations or bodies representing a sector can create codes to help their sector comply with the GDPR in an efficient and potentially cost effective way. As provided by the non-exhaustive list contained in Article 40(2) of the GDPR, codes of conduct may notably cover topics such as:
 fair and transparent processing;
 legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts;
 the collection of personal data; the pseudonymisation of personal data;
 the information provided to individuals and the exercise of individuals’ rights;
 the information provided to and the protection of children (including mechanisms for
obtaining parental consent);
 technical and organisational measures, including data protection by design and by default and
security measures;
 breach notification;
 data transfers outside the EU; or
 dispute resolution procedures.
12 However, a monitoring body may be accredited for more than one code provided it satisfies the requirements for accreditation.
13 As per Recital 98 of the GDPR.
14 See also Paragraphs 64– 67 below.
 **Adopted 7**

9. The GDPR in repealing the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) provides more specific and detailed provisions around codes, the requirements which need to be met and the procedures involved in attaining approval, as well as their registration, publication and promotion once approved. Those provisions, in conjunction with these guidelines, will help encourage code owners to have a direct input into the establishment of data protection standards and rules for their processing sectors.
10. It is important to note that codes are one of a number of voluntary tools that can be used from a suite of data protection accountability tools which the GDPR offers, such as Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)15 and Certification.16 They are a mechanism which can be used to assist organisations in demonstrating their compliance with the GDPR.17
4 WHATARETHEBENEFITSOFCODES?
11. Codes represent an opportunity to establish a set of rules which contribute to the proper application of the GDPR in a practical, transparent and potentially cost effective manner that takes on board the nuances for a particular sector and/or its processing activities. In this regard codes can be drawn up for controllers and processors taking account of the specific characteristics of processing carried out in certain sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises.18 They have the potential to be an especially important and beneficial tool for both SMEs and micro enterprise businesses19 by providing a mechanism which allows them to achieve data protection compliance in a more cost effective way.
 For example, micro enterprises involved in similar health research activities could come together via their relevant associations and collectively develop a code in respect of their collection and processing of health data rather than attempting to carry out such comprehensive data protection analysis on their own. Codes will also benefit supervisory authorities by allowing them to gain a better understanding and insight of the data processing activities of a specific profession, industry or other sector.
12. Codes can help controllers and processors to comply with the GDPR by governing areas such as fair and transparent processing, legitimate interests, security and data protection by design and default measures and controller obligations. Codes are accessible to all processing sectors and can
15 Codes of Conduct and Certification are voluntary accountability tools, whereas a DPIA will be mandatory in certain circumstances. For further information on other accountability tools please see the general guidance webpage of the EDPB (www.edpb.europa.eu).
16 See Article 42 of the GDPR and note the EDPB Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR.
17 Adherence to a code does not, of itself, guarantee compliance with the GDPR or immunity for controllers/processors from sanctions or liabilities provided under the GDPR.
18 See Recital 98 of the GDPR in respect of Article 40(1). For example, a code could be appropriately scaled to meet the requirement of micro organisations in addition to small and medium enterprises.
19 Article 40(1) of the GDPR in particular identifies codes as a solution to address the needs of such enterprises. 
**Adopted 8**
 
be drafted in as narrow or as wide-ranging a manner as is befitting that particular sector20, provided that the code contributes to the proper and effective application of the GDPR.21
 For example, approval could be sought for a set of rules in respect of how a specific charitable sector would ensure its processing arrangements were fair and transparent. Alternatively, the specific charitable sector could decide to draft a code, which incorporates and properly applies a multitude of different provisions under the GDPR to cover all their processing activities, from the lawful basis for the collection of personal data to the notification of personal data breaches.
13. Codes can provide a degree of co-regulation and they could decrease the level of reliance that controllers and processors may sometimes place upon data protection supervisory authorities to provide more granular guidance for their specific processing activities.
14. Codes can provide a degree of autonomy and control for controllers and processors to formulate and agree best practice rules for their given sectors. They can provide an opportunity to consolidate best practice processing operations in specific fields. They can also become a vital resource that businesses can rely upon to address critical issues in their processing procedures and to achieve better data protection compliance.
15. Codes can provide much needed confidence and legal certainty by providing practical solutions to problems identified by particular sectors in relation to common processing activities. They encourage the development of a collective and consistent approach to the data processing needs of a particular sector.
 20 Article 40(2) of the GDPR refers to codes being prepared by representative organisations of ‘categories of controllers and processors’. Therefore this could include cross sector codes where practical provided the representativeness criteria is met.
21 A narrowly focused code must make it sufficiently clear to data subjects (and to the satisfaction of a CompSA) that controllers/processors adhering to the code does not necessarily ensure compliance with all of the legislation. An appropriate safeguard in this instance could be to ensure adequate transparency regarding the limited scope of the code to those signed up to the code and data subjects.
**Adopted 9**

16. Codes can be an effective tool to earn the trust and confidence of data subjects. They can address a variety of issues, many of which may arise from concerns of the general public or even perceived concerns from within the sector itself, and as such constitute a tool for enhancing transparency towards individuals regarding the processing of their personal data.
 For example, in the context of processing health data for research purposes, concerns over the appropriate measures to be adopted in order to promote compliance with the rules applying to the processing of sensitive health information could be allayed by the existence of an approved and detailed code. Such a code could outline in a fair and transparent manner the following:
 the relevant safeguards to be applied regarding the information to be provided to data subjects;
 relevant safeguards to be applied in respect of the data collected from third parties;
 communication or dissemination of the data;
 the criteria to be implemented to ensure respect for the principle of data
minimisation;
 the specific security measures;
 appropriate retention schedules; and
 the mechanisms to manage the data as a result of the exercise of data subjects'
rights (As per Articles 32 and 89 of the GDPR)
17. Codes may also provide to be a significant and useful mechanism in the area of international transfers. New provisions in the GDPR allow third parties to agree to adhere to approved codes in order to satisfy legal requirements to provide appropriate safeguards in relation to international transfers of personal data to third countries.22 Additionally, approved codes of this nature may result in the promotion and cultivation of the level of protection which the GDPR provides to the wider international community while also permitting sustainable legally compliant international transfers of personal data. They may also serve as a mechanism which further develops and fosters data subject trust and confidence in the processing of data outside of the European Economic Area.23
18. Approved codes have the potential to act as effective accountability tools for both processors and controllers. As outlined in Recital 77 and Article 24(3) of the GDPR, adherence to an approved code of conduct is envisaged, amongst others, as an appropriate method for a data controller or processor to demonstrate compliance with regard to specific parts or principles of the Regulation
22 See Article 40(2)(j) and Article 40(3) of the GDPR.
23 The Board will provide separate guidelines in relation to the use of codes as a mechanism to facilitate international transfers.
 **Adopted 10**

or the Regulation as a whole.24 Adherence to an approved code of conduct will also be a factor taken into consideration by supervisory authorities when evaluating specific features of data processing such as the security aspects25, assessing the impact of processing under a DPIA26 or when imposing an administrative fine.27 In case of a breach of one of the provisions of the Regulation, adherence to an approved code of conduct might be indicative of how comprehensive the need is to intervene with an effective, proportionate, dissuasive administrative fine or other corrective measure from the supervisory authority.28
5 ADMISSIBILITYOFADRAFTCODE29
19. There are a number of conditions to be met before a CompSA would be in a position to undertake to fully assess and review a code for the purposes of Article 40(5) of the GDPR. They aim to facilitate an efficient evaluation of any draft code. The following criteria apply:
5.1 Explanatory statement and supporting documentation
20. Every draft code which is submitted for approval must contain a clear and concise explanatory statement, which provides details as to the purpose of the code, the scope of the code30 and how it will facilitate the effective application of this Regulation.31 This will assist in expediting the process and in providing the requisite clarity to accompany a submission. The submission must also include supporting documentation, where relevant, to underpin the draft code and explanatory statement.32
5.2 Representative
21. A code must be submitted by an association/consortium of associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors (code owners) in accordance with Article 40(2). A non-exhaustive list of example of possible code owners would include: trade and representative associations, sectoral organisations, academic organisations and interest groups.
22. The code owners must demonstrate to the CompSA that they are an effective representative body and that they are capable of understanding the needs of their members and clearly defining the
24 See also Article 24(3) and 28(5) of the GDPR.
25 Article 32(3) of the GDPR.
26 Article 35(8) of the GDPR.

28 Ibid
29 This also applies for all codes (national and transnational) as well as amended or extended codes.
30 The following non-exhaustive categories may apply: identification of members, processing activity, data subjects, types of data, jurisdictions, concerned SAs (Article 4(22) of the GDPR).
31 This document provides an opportunity for code owners to demonstrate the rationale and basis for approval of their code. It provides a platform for code owners to outline the appropriateness of safeguards proposed and to demonstrate that proposed mechanisms are fit for purpose.
32 Examples could include a consultation summary, membership information or research that demonstrates a need for the code.

processing activity or sector to which the code is intended to apply. Depending on the definition and parameters of the sector concerned, representativeness can be derived amongst others from the following elements:
 Number or percentage of potential code members from the relevant controllers or processors in that sector;
 Experience of the representative body with regard to the sector and processing activities concerning the code.
Processing Scope
The draft code must have a defined scope that clearly and precisely determines the processing operations (or characteristics of the processing) of personal data covered by it, as well as the categories of controllers or processors it governs. This will include the processing issues that the code seeks to address and provide practical solutions.
Territorial scope
The draft code must specify whether it is a national or transnational code and provide details in relation to territorial scope, identifying all relevant jurisdictions to which it intends to apply. For any transnational codes (as well as amended or extended transnational codes), a list of concerned SAs must be included. Appendix 1 outlines the distinction between national and transnational codes.
Submission to a CompSA
The code owners must ensure that the supervisory authority chosen to review a draft code is competent in accordance with Article 55 of the GDPR.33 Appendix 2 provides further information which may assist code owners in choosing a CompSA for a transnational code.
Oversight of mechanisms
The draft code must propose mechanisms that allow for the monitoring of compliance with its provisions by stakeholders who undertake to apply it.34 This applies to both public and non-public sector codes.
Monitoring body
A draft code which involves processing activities of private, non-public authorities or bodies must also identify a monitoring body and contain mechanisms which enable that body to carry out its
   33 Article 55 of the GDPR states that each supervisory authority is competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to and the exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with the Regulation on the territory of its own Member State. Also see Recital 122 of the GDPR.
34 See Article 40(4) of the GDPR.
**Adopted 12**

functions as per Article 41 of the GDPR.35 The identified monitoring body or bodies must have the appropriate standing to meet the requirements of being fully accountable in their role.36 To this end, the monitoring body or bodies have to be accredited by the CompSA according to Article 41(1) of the GDPR.37
5.8 Consultation
28. A draft code must contain information as to the extent of consultation carried out. Recital 99 of the GDPR indicates when drafting a code (or amending/extending) a consultation should take place with the relevant stakeholders including data subjects, where feasible. As such, code owners should confirm and demonstrate that an appropriate level of consultation has taken place with the relevant stakeholders when submitting the code for approval. Where relevant, this will include information about other codes of conduct that potential code members may be subject to and reflect how their code complements other codes. This should also outline the level and nature of consultation which took place with their members, other stakeholders and data subjects or associations/bodies representing them.38 In practice, a consultation is highly recommended with the members forming part of the organisation or body acting as the code owner and also taking into account the processing activity with the clients of such members. Where no consultation has been carried out with regard to relevant and specific stakeholders due to the lack of feasibility, it will be a matter for the code owner to explain this position.
5.9 National legislation
29. Code owners must provide confirmation that the draft code is in compliance with relevant national legislation, in particular, where the code involves a sector which is governed by specific provisions set out in national law or it concerns processing operations that have to be assessed, taking into account specific requirements and relevant legal obligations under national law.
5.10 Language
30. Code owners should comply with the language requirements of the CompSA to whom they will submit their code. In general, a code should be submitted in the language of the CompSA of that Member State.39 For transnational codes, the code should be submitted in the language of the CompSA and also in English.40
5.11 Checklist
35 A code involving the public sector will still need to contain suitable mechanisms to monitor the code.
36 As per Article 83(4) (c) of the GDPR infringements in relation to the obligations of a monitoring body shall be subject to an administrative fine.
37 See section below entitled ‘Accreditation Requirements for Monitoring Bodies’ on page 24.
38 For instance, codes owners could outline how they assessed the submissions received following consultation. 39 Some Member States may have national legislation which requires a draft code to be submitted in their national language, and it is recommended that code owners explore this issue with the relevant CompSA in advance of formally submitting their draft code for approval.
40 English is the working language of the EDPB as per Section 23 Rules of Procedure of the EDPB.
 **Adopted 13**

31. Ultimately, it will be a matter for the chosen CompSA to determine whether the draft code goes to the next stage of evaluation i.e. a CompSA undertakes to carry out a full assessment of the content in line with Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR and the procedures detailed below. The Checklist outlined in Appendix 3 should be used to reference documentation submitted to a CompSA and to help frame the submission of the draft code.
 32.
6 CRITERIAFORAPPROVINGCODES
Code owners will need to be able to demonstrate how their code will contribute to the proper application of the GDPR, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors as well as the specific requirements and obligations of the controllers or processors to whom it relates. There are a number of aspects to this overarching requirement. Code owners should be able to demonstrate that their draft code:
6.1
    
meets a particular need of that sector or processing activity, facilitates the application of the GDPR,
specifies the application of the GPDR,
provides sufficient safeguards41, and
provides effective mechanisms for monitoring compliance with a code.
Meets a particular need
33. Code owners are required to demonstrate a need for the establishment of a code. As such a code must address data protection issues which arise for a particular sector or processing activity.
 For example, the sector of information systems for the detection of consumer credit risks may identify a need to formulate a code which provides sufficient safeguards and mechanisms to ensure that the data collected are relevant, accurate and are used exclusively for the specific and legitimate purpose of protecting credit. Similarly, the health research sector may identify a need to formulate a code which provides consistency in approach by setting out standards to adequately meet explicit consent and accompanying accountability requirements under the GDPR.
34. Code owners should be able to explain and set out the problems the code seeks to address and substantiate how the solutions the code offers will be effective and beneficial not only for their members but also for data subjects.
6.2 Facilitates the effective application of the GDPR
41 For example, ‘high risk’ sectors, such as processing children’s or health data would be expected to contain more robust and stringent safeguards, given the sensitivity of the personal data in question.
 **Adopted 14**

35. As per recital 98 of the GDPR, a code, in order to attain approval, will require code owners to be able demonstrate that their code facilitates the effective application of the GDPR. In this regard, a code will need to clearly stipulate its sector-specific application of the GDPR and identify and address such specific needs of a sector.42
 For example, providing a list of definitions that are specific to the sector as well as an adequate focus on topics that are particularly relevant to the sector are ways to facilitate the effective application of the GDPR. Using sector-specific terminology to detail the implementation of the requirements of the GDPR in the sector may also improve the clear understanding of the rules by the industry and thus facilitate the effective application of the GDPR. A code should fully take into account the likely risks involved with a particular sector processing activity and appropriately calibrate the related obligations of controllers or processors to whom it applies in light of those risks in that specific sector i.e. providing examples of acceptable terms and conditions in relation to the use of personal data in direct marketing. In terms of format, the content of the code should also be presented in a way that facilitates its understanding, practical use and effective application of the GDPR.
6.3 Specifies the application of the GDPR
36. Codes will need to specify the practical application of the GDPR and accurately reflect the nature of the processing activity or sector. They should be able to provide clear industry specific improvements in terms of compliance with data protection law. Codes will need to set out realistic and attainable standards for all their members, and they will need to be of a necessary quality and internal consistency to provide sufficient added value.43 In other words, a draft code will need to be adequately focused on particular data protection areas44 and issues in the specific sector to which it applies and it will need to provide sufficiently clear and effective solutions to address those areas and issues.45
37. A code should not just re-state the GDPR.46 Instead, it should aim to codify how the GDPR shall apply in a specific, practical and precise manner. The agreed standards and rules will need to be unambiguous, concrete, attainable and enforceable (testable). Setting out distinct rules in the particular field is an acceptable method by which a code can add value. Using terminology that is unique and relevant to the industry and providing concrete case scenarios or specific examples of ‘best practice’47 may help to meet this requirement.48
42 See Article 40(1) of the GDPR.
43 This standard was first applied in WP 13 DG XV D/5004/98 adopted on 10th September 1998.
44 Such as those listed in Article 40(2) of the GDPR.
45 This requirement reflects the previous position of the WP 29 as outlined in Working Document on Codes WP 13 DG XV D/5004/98 adopted on 10th September 1998.
46 Providing restatements of data protection law was a regular feature of unsuccessful draft codes which were submitted for approval to WP 29.
47 And ‘unacceptable practices’.
48 A code should avoid, where possible, being overly legalistic.
 **Adopted 15**

38. Outlining plans to promote the approved code so individuals are informed of its existence and contents may also assist in reaching the standard of “specifying the application of the GDPR”. It is vital that codes are able to provide operational meaning to the principles of data protection as articulated in Article 5 of the GDPR. It is also vital that codes properly take into account relevant opinions and positions published or endorsed by the Board to that particular sector or processing activity.49 For example, codes containing specifications with regard to processing activities, might also facilitate the identification of adequate legal grounds for these processing activities in the Member States to which they intend to apply.
6.4 Provides sufficient safeguards
39. A code should also meet the requirements of Article 40(5). Approval will only be forthcoming when it is determined that a draft code provides sufficient appropriate safeguards.50 Codes owners will need to appropriately satisfy a CompSA that their code contains suitable and effective safeguards to mitigate the risk around data processing and the rights and freedoms of individuals.51 It will be a matter for the code owners to provide clear evidence showing that their code will meet these requirements.
 For example, in ‘high risk’ processing activities such as the large scale processing of children’s or health data, profiling or systematic monitoring, it would be expected that the code would contain more demanding requirements upon controllers and processors to reflect an adequate level of protection. Additionally, code owners may benefit from carrying out a more extensive consultation as per Recital 99 of the GDPR to underpin a code involving the processing of such high risk areas.
6.5 Provides mechanisms which will allow for effective oversight
40. As per Article 40(4) of the GDPR, a code requires the implementation of suitable mechanisms to ensure that those rules are appropriately monitored and that efficient and meaningful enforcement measures are put in place to ensure full compliance. A code specifically needs to identify and propose structures and procedures which provide for effective monitoring and enforcement of infringements. A draft code will also need to identify an appropriate body which has at its disposal mechanisms to enable that body to provide for the effective monitoring of compliance with the code. Mechanisms may include regular audit and reporting requirements, clear and transparent complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures, concrete sanctions and remedies in cases of violations of the code, as well as policies for reporting breaches of its provisions.
49 They will also need to fully take on board relevant National and European jurisprudence.
50 See Recital 98 of the GDPR.
51 Safeguards may also apply to monitoring bodies and their capabilities in carrying out their role in an effective manner.
 **Adopted 16**

41. A draft code will be required to have a monitoring body where it involves processing carried out by non-public authorities and bodies. In essence, a code must not only consider the contents of rules applicable to that sector’s processing activity, but it must also implement monitoring mechanisms which will ensure the effective application of those rules. A draft code could successfully propose a number of different monitoring mechanisms where there are multiple monitoring bodies to carry out effective oversight. However, all proposed monitoring mechanisms as to how to give effect to adequate monitoring of a code will need to be clear, suitable, attainable, efficient and enforceable (testable). Code owners will need to set out the rationale and demonstrate why their proposals for monitoring are appropriate and operationally feasible.52
7 SUBMISSION,ADMISSIBILITYANDAPPROVAL53(NATIONALCODE)
7.1 Submission
42. Code owners should formally submit their draft Code in either an electronic or written (printed/hard copy) format to the CompSA.54 The CompSA will revert to the code owners acknowledging receipt of the submission, and proceed to carry out a review as to whether the draft code meets the admissibility criteria as set out above55 before proceeding to carry out a full evaluation of its contents.
7.2 Admissibility of a Code
43. If the draft Code is not accepted on the basis of failing to meet the criteria for admissibility56 the CompSA will respond to the code owners in writing outlining the basis for its decision. The process would come to an end on this basis and a new submission would be required to be made by the code owners.57
44. If the draft code meets the criteria set out above, the CompSA should write to the code owners with confirmation that it will proceed to the next stage of the process and assess the draft code’s content in accordance with the relevant procedures provided under national law.
7.3 Approval
52 The Article 29 Working Party document “Judging industry self-regulation: when does it make a meaningful contribution to the level of data protection in a third country?” WP7 adopted 14 January 1998 is also an informative document providing further insight into assessing the value of a code and the general grounds required for it to be effective. It is recommended that this document is also considered (where relevant) when formulating a code.
53 Including amending and extending codes previously approved.
54 Obviously such an authority will be the National SA for the members to whom the code applies. It is also important that code owners clearly stipulate to the CompSA that they are formally submitting a draft Code for approval and that they clearly indicate the jurisdictional scope of the code. Also please note Appendix 1 in relation to the distinction between national and transnational codes.
55 See also Appendix 3 checklist.
56 Ibid
57 It is worth noting that refusal at this stage of the approval process will most likely be based on general or procedural preliminary requirements rather than substantive or core issues associated with the provisions of the draft code.
 **Adopted 17**

45. Unless a specific timeline is prescribed under national law, the CompSA should draft an opinion within a reasonable period of time and it should keep the draft owners regularly updated on the process and indicative timelines. The opinion should outline the basis for its decision in line with the criteria for approval as outlined above.58
46. If the decision made by the CompSA is to refuse approval, then the process will be completed and it will be a matter for the code owners to assess the findings of the opinion and reconsider the draft code on that basis. It would also be necessary for the code owners to formally re-submit an updated draft code at a later stage, if they choose to do so.
47. If the CompSA approves a draft code, it will be necessary for it to register and publish the code (via its website and/or other appropriate methods of communication).59 Article 40(11) also requires the Board to make publicly available all approved codes.

8.1 Submission
48. Code owners should formally submit their draft code in either an electronic or written format to a CompSA which will act as the principal authority for the approval of the code.61 The CompSA will revert to the code owners acknowledging receipt of the documentation and proceed to carry out a review as to whether the draft code meets the requirements as set out above62 before proceeding to carry out a full evaluation of its contents. The CompSA will immediately notify all other supervisory authorities of the submission of a code and provide the salient details which will allow for ease of identification and reference. All supervisory authorities should confirm by return whether they are concerned SAs as per Article 4(22) (a) and (b) of the GDPR.63
8.2 Admissibility of a Code
49. If the draft code is not accepted on the basis of failing to meet the admissibility criteria set out above, the CompSA will write to the code owners outlining the basis for its decision. The process
58 By doing so the CompSA can provide helpful feedback to code owners if they choose to review, amend and re- submit a draft code at a future date.

60 Including amending and extending codes previously approved.
61 This should be read in the context of the procedure outlined below.
62 See also Appendix 3 checklist.
63 This is important as it is envisaged that co-reviewers of the draft code would be supervisory authorities which are concerned by the processing of personal data because the controller or processor is established on the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority or because “data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are substantially affected or likely to be substantially affected by the processing”.

will come to an end on this basis and a new submission would be required to be made by the code owners.64 The CompSA will also issue a notification updating all concerned SAs of the position.
If the draft code is accepted by the CompSA on the basis of meeting the admissibility criteria, the CompSA should write to the code owners with confirmation that they will proceed to the next stage of the process and assess the draft code’s content. This will trigger the following informal cooperation procedure in respect of assessing the code for approval.
Cooperation
The CompSA will issue a notification updating all SAs65 of the position, identifying concerned SAs and they will make a request seeking, on a voluntary basis, a maximum of two co-reviewers to assist with the substantive assessment of the draft code. The appointment of co-reviewers will be made on a first come basis.66 The role of co-reviewers will be to assist the CompSA in assessing the draft code. Once the co-reviewers are confirmed, comments from them on the content of the code should be provided within thirty days from their confirmation as co-reviewers. These comments will then be considered by the CompSA when carrying out its assessment for approval. As per Article 40(7) of the GDPR, the CompSA will make the final determination as to whether the draft decision should be submitted to the Board as per Articles 63 and 64 of the GDPR.67
The CompSA should aim to arrive at a decision within a reasonable period of time, and it should keep the code owners regularly updated on the progress and indicative timelines. It should outline the basis for its decision (to refuse or to approve a code) in line with the general grounds for approval and communicate that decision in a timely manner to the code owners.
Refusal
If the decision made by the CompSA is to refuse referring a draft code to the Board the process will come to an end and it will be a matter for the code owners to analyse the findings of the decision and reconsider revising their draft code. It would also be necessary for the code owners to resubmit the code for an approval at a later stage, if they choose to do so. The CompSA should also notify all concerned SAs of its position and reasons for refusing to approve a code.
Preparation for submission to the Board
If the CompSA aims to approve the draft code, before submission to the EDPB, the CompSA will circulate its draft approval to all concerned SAs. All concerned SAs will have 30 days to respond
52.
8.4
53.
8.5
54.
 64 It is worth noting that refusal at this stage of the approval process will most likely be based on general or procedural preliminary requirements rather than substantive or core issues associated with the provision of the draft code.
65 Concerned SAs should be identifiable from the scope of the draft code.
66 This request will remain open for ten working days. While co-reviewers are being identified, the CompSA will proceed with the assessment. As a rule, the CompSA will consult two co-reviewers whenever 14 Member States or more are concerned by the code. Under this threshold it is possible to have one or two co-reviewers depending on the specific case.
67 This can only occur where the CompSA aims to approve the draft code. See Article 40(7) and Article 64(1). **Adopted 19**

and any significant issues could be brought to the relevant EDPB subgroup for discussion. If the concerned SAs do not respond, the code will proceed to the next stage of the process.
8.6 The Board
55. If the decision is to refer the matter to the Board as per Article 40(7) of the GDPR. The CompSA will communicate that decision to all supervisory authorities as per the consistency mechanisms procedure.68 The CompSA will also refer the matter to the Board in line with its rules of procedure and Article 40(7) of the GDPR.
56. Under Article 64 the Board shall issue an opinion pertaining to matters outlined in Article 40(7) of the GDPR.69 The Rules of Procedure of the Board together with the provisions of Article 64 will apply to the Board and the CompSA when conducting an assessment and communicating a decision on the approval of transnational codes.
8.7 Approval
57. The opinion of the Board will be communicated to the CompSA as per Article 64(5) of the GDPR and it will be a matter for the CompSA as to whether it will maintain or amend its draft decision as per Article 40(5).70 An Opinion of the Board may also be submitted to the Commission pursuant to Article 40(8) and the Board, under Article 40(11), will collate all approved transnational codes and make them publicly available.
9 ENGAGEMENT
58. It is important to note that the assessment process should not serve as an opportunity to further consult on the provisions of the submitted code with the CompSA. The CompSA is tasked, under Article 40(5), to provide an opinion on whether the draft code complies with the GDPR.71 As such, the communication envisaged between the CompSA and the code owners during this stage of the process will be primarily for the purposes of clarification and to assist in carrying out an evaluation under Article 40 and 41. It is anticipated that code owners will liaise, as appropriate, with supervisory authorities in advance of submitting their draft code for approval. In principle, the approval stage of the process should not invite further consultation by the code owners on particular provisions in the draft code nor should it allow for an extended assessment whereby amendments are continually submitted to the CompSA. It is also imperative that code owners are available to provide answers on points of clarification in respect of their draft code and that they are capable of doing so within a reasonable period of time. It is important that the code owners are prepared and organised to address queries in an efficient and able manner. It is recommended that a single or dedicated point of contact is provided to the CompSA. It will be at the discretion of
68 See Article 64(4) of the GDPR according to which the views of other supervisory authorities concerned should be presented along with the draft CompSA decision.
69 See task of Board as per Article 70 (1)(x) of the GDPR.
70 See Article 64(7) and note the procedures invoked if a CompSA disagrees with the Board’s opinion as per Article 64(8) of the GDPR.
71 The CompSA may also advise and, where relevant, make recommendations to code owners in relation to the content and format of its draft code.
 **Adopted 20**

the CompSA as to whether it needs further information before making its decision on the draft code and it will also have discretion to determine the manner of any communication between the parties. For the purposes of continuity, the CompSA will also remain as the principal point of contact during the entire approval process for transnational codes.
10 THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION
59. The Commission may decide by way of an implementing Act that an approved transnational code
will have general validity within the Union and shall ensure appropriate publicity if it were to do so.72
11 MONITORING OF A CODE
60. In order for a code (national or transnational) to be approved, a monitoring body (or bodies), must be identified as part of the code and accredited by the CompSA as being capable of effectively monitoring the code.73 The CompSA will submit its draft requirements for accreditation of a monitoring body to the Board pursuant to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 of the GDPR. Once approved by the Board the requirements can then be applied by the CompSA to accredit a monitoring body.
61. The GDPR does not define the term ‘accreditation’. However, Article 41(2) of the GDPR outlines general requirements for the accreditation of the monitoring body. There are a number of requirements which should be met in order to satisfy the CompSA to accredit a monitoring body. Code owners will need to explain and demonstrate how their proposed monitoring body meets the requirements set out in Article 41(2) to obtain accreditation.
62. The GDPR provides flexibility around the type and structure of a monitoring body to be accredited under Article 41. Code owners may decide to use external or internal monitoring bodies provided that in both cases the relevant body meets the accreditation requirements of Article 41(2) as outlined in the eight requirements listed below.
12 ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MONITORING BODIES
12.1 Independence
63. The code owners will need to demonstrate that the body concerned is appropriately independent in relation to its impartiality of function from the code members and the profession, industry or sector to which the code applies. Independence could be evidenced through a number of areas
72 See Article 40(9) and Article 40(10). Such a decision would also permit controllers and processors that are not subject to the GPDR to make binding and enforceable commitments regarding a validated code (See Article 40(3)). This would allow data transfers to third countries or international organisations on the basis that appropriate safeguards are in place and rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects (See also Article 46(1) and 46(2)(e)).
73 GDPR Article 41 (1). Also note that Article 41 does not apply to public authorities or bodies.
 **Adopted 21**
 
such as the monitoring body’s funding, appointment of members/staff, decision making process and more generally in terms of its organisational structure. These are considered in more detail below.
64. There are two main models of monitoring which could be used by code owners for fulfilling the monitoring body requirements: external and internal monitoring body. There is some flexibility within these two types of monitoring approaches and different versions could be proposed which are appropriate given the context for the code. Examples of internal monitoring bodies could include an ad hoc internal committee or a separate, independent department within the code owner. It will be for the code owners to explain the risk management approach with regard to its impartiality and independence.
65. For instance, where an internal monitoring body is proposed, there should be separate staff and management, accountability and function from other areas of the organisation. This may be achieved in a number of ways, for example, the use of effective organisational and information barriers and separate reporting management structures for the association and monitoring body. Similar to a data protection officer, the monitoring body should be able to act free from instructions and shall be protected from any sort of sanctions or interference (whether direct or indirect) as a consequence of the fulfilment of its task.
66. Independence could require that an external counsel or other party having participated in the drafting of the code of conduct, would need to demonstrate that there were appropriate safeguards in place to sufficiently mitigate a risk of independence or a conflict of interest. The monitoring body would need to provide evidence as to the appropriateness of the mechanisms which would satisfactorily identify and mitigate such risks.74 A monitoring body will need to identify risks to its impartiality on an ongoing basis, such as its activities or from its relationships. If a risk to impartiality is identified, the monitoring body should demonstrate how it removes or minimises such risk and uses an appropriate mechanism for safeguarding impartiality.
67. Independence could also be demonstrated by showing full autonomy for the management of the budget and other resources, in particular in cases where the monitoring body is internal. A monitoring body would also need to be able to act independently in its choice and application of sanctions against a controller or processor adhering to the code. In essence, the body - either internal or external - will need to act independently from code owners and members within the scope of the code in performing its tasks and exercising its powers.
12.2 Conflict of interest75
68. It will need to be demonstrated that the exercise of the monitoring body’s tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. As such, code owners will need to demonstrate that the proposed monitoring body will refrain from any action that is incompatible with its tasks and duties and that
74 The context for the code will determine the approach to take. For example, a proposal where there is an adequate separation of duties, whereby the monitoring body personnel did not write, pilot or test the code may suffice.
75 Impartiality of function, i.e. the ability to act autonomously.
 **Adopted 22**

safeguards are put in place to ensure that will not engage with an incompatible occupation. Similarly, the monitoring body must remain free from external influence, whether direct or indirect, and shall neither seek nor take instructions from any person, organisation or association. The body should have its own staff which are chosen by them or some other body independent of the code and it should be subject to the exclusive direction of those bodies only. In the case of an internal monitoring body, it shall be protected from any sort of sanctions or interference (whether direct or indirect) by the code owner, other relevant bodies,76 or members of the code as a consequence of the fulfilment of its tasks.
12.3 Expertise
69. The code owners will need to be able to demonstrate that the monitoring body has the requisite level of expertise to carry out its role in an effective manner. As such, the submission will need to include details as to the knowledge and experience of the body in respect of data protection law as well as of the particular sector or processing activity. For example, being able to point to previous experience of acting in a monitoring capacity for a particular sector may assist in meeting this requirement. Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of data protection issues and expert knowledge of the specific processing activities which are the subject matter of the code will be welcomed. The staff of the proposed monitoring body should also have appropriate operational experience and training for carrying out the monitoring of compliance such as in the field of auditing, monitoring, or quality assurance activities.
12.4 Established procedures and structures
70. A monitoring body will also need to have appropriate governance structures and procedures which allow it to adequately:
 assess for eligibility of controllers and processors to apply the code;
 to monitor compliance with its provisions; and
 to carry out reviews of the code’s operation.
71. Comprehensive vetting procedures should be drafted which adequately assess the eligibility of controllers and processors to sign up to and comply with the code. It should also ensure that the provisions of the code are capable of being met by the controllers and processors.
72. Procedures and structures to actively and effectively monitor compliance by members of the code will be required. These could include random or unannounced audits, annual inspections, regular reporting and the use of questionnaires.77The monitoring procedures can be designed in different ways as long as they take into account factors such as the risks raised by the data processing in scope of the code, complaints received or specific incidents and the number of members of the code etc. Consideration could be given to the publication of audit reports as well as to the findings of periodic reporting from controllers and processors within the scope of the code.
76 Bodies who represent categories of controllers or processors.
77 This could also help prevent a situation whereby members are monitored repeatedly while others are not.

**ALL BELOW FIELDS ARE REQUIRED**
<h2 id=""The-Problem"">The Problem</h2>

There has to be a means by which a user logs into DataHub.

<h2 id=""User-Story"">User Story</h2>

The user comes to datahub.aecmaster.com and sees [this login page](https://flowbite.com/blocks/marketing/login/#background-image) but without the password field. The background image is randomly picked from 10 different images related to construction.

<h2 id=""request-type"">Request Type A/B</h2>

Type A: This request creates something entirely new.

<h2 id=""owner"">Owner</h2>

[mikkokotila](https://github.com/mikkokotila)

<h2 id=""summary"">Summary</h2>

This request will add a new screen, which allows users to log in passwordless or with SSO (Google and Apple).

<h2 id=""is-this-really-necessary"">Is This Really Necessary?</h2>
A login screen is necessary, and making it passwordless seems to be the best way to future-proof the login approach. Adding SSO covers the drawback of sometimes issues arising with receiving the magic link.
<h2 id=""motivation"">Motivation</h2>
The user does not currently have any way to log in to DataHub and we don't have any way to protect the views from unauthorized use.

<h2 id=""named-concepts"">Named Concepts</h2>

**passwordless** means that the user can log in with a magic link without ever having a password.

**SSO** means single-sign-on (e.g. sign-in with Google)

<h2 id=""Examples-Risks-Assumptions"">Examples, Risks & Assumptions</h2>

1. *Explain concretely what will manifest as a result of this RFW.*

The ability for users to log in without a password.

2. *Explain how is it different from what is already manifesting i.e. what we already have?*

We don't have any way for users to log in.

3. *Explain what users/brands will experience as a result of this RFW. How will they feel as a result of it? How will they benefit as a result of it?*

Scenario A:

The user will come to the login screen. The user will then insert either their email address or phone number. They will then receive the magic link. The user clicks the link on their device. If the link is valid, the user then is allowed to come in.

Scenario B:

The user will come to the login screen. The user will click the SSO button of their choice. They will then go through the prompts of that SSO. If the sign-in is valid, the user then is allowed to come in.

4. *If applicable, provide sample messages for any new messages the system will display as a result of this RFW.*

This is available in the Figma mocks.

5. *Define what is out of scope in this request.*

The ability to create/delete/update user accounts.

6. *What are the data protection, privacy, and security assumptions made for this request (for example, should this be GDPR, compliant, etc)*

The system has to be a GDPR complaint.

7. *Explain how this user story will be supported (i.e. customer support - if the user story fails technically, how will the user be supported).*

There is no support function provided at this point.

8. *Explain how this user story impacts revenue or billing (if applicable).*

NA

9. *State any additional risks identified as a result of this user story.*

- Not following GDPR
- Not following security best practices
- Overcomplicating the actual build of this request

<h2 id=""success-metrics"">Success Metrics</h2>

The user is able to log in.

<h2 id=""conceptual-design"">Conceptual Design</h2>

The user is provided with two different ways to log in: 

- magic link
- SSO

<h2 id=""drawbacks"">Drawbacks</h2>
If the provider for the magic link has a problem, the user can't come in. This is why we provided SSO as a backup. 

<h2 id=""alternatives"">Alternatives</h2>

The alternative is to make either a password login or use just SSO. 

<h2 id=""new-data"">New Data</h2>

- User email AND/OR a user phone number

It's a directory of open source fonts, that are each hosted individually on NPM. 

https://github.com/fontsource/font-files

https://github.com/fontsource/font-files/tree/main/fonts/other/bravura

See directions for installing Bravura via NPM:
https://fontsource.org/fonts/bravura/install

We could try to use fontsource and make sure all the font files are the most up to date versions (I see their version of Bravura might be slightly outdated...).

Or we can take the same approach and publish all the vexflow compatible fonts as individual NPM packages.

Then a developer can run `npm install @vexflow-fonts/leland` to install the web font locally in their project. Then, when your project goes live, your bundler will put the font files on your own web server. Since it is self hosted, you can control the GDPR compliance.

* [X] I have searched the issue tracker for a feature request that matches the one I want to file, without success.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
1) There is a vacuum of on-premise hostable open source whiteboard software in teaching (universities). Teachers have to use external services at their own responsibility (and I am not even sure if that is legal).
2) Draw.io is a fantastic and flexible tool (custom libraries - yeah!) for visualization of many applications in teaching (and developing curricula).
3) Being able to use draw.io with collaboration in teaching (whiteboard-function, collaborative concept development) would be fantastic :-)
4) We could not yet find a way to run draw.io with real-time (or even non-real-time) completely on premise - which is a serious show-stopper for security and privacy aware Universities in the EU: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forbids to require students to register and to have data processed on such external premises **without specific individual and optional consent** - or within the jurisdiction of the US CLOUD Act (US servers) **in general**.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like a draw.io collaborative whiteboard that is completely hosted on premise. The easiest solution I see is to allow the NC plugin to work with own instances of draw.io and/or gitlab (maybe easiest on an own gitlab instance).

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A) I am currently working with local files (or files synced over NC) and processing them externally on app.diagrams.net. This is not real-time collaborative, end even requires manual version management (including the need to consolidate parallel new versions).

B) Collaboration **is** possible at gitlabs.com - but with external accounts and external data processing in the US (see GDPR above)

C) Draw.io has a Nextcloud client with auto-save function. But this is only an API to pass the authentification to an external engine (app.diagrams.net) - See above for external data processing.

D) We do run a Confluence wiki, but I have no idea how that would help us hosting collaborative real-time whiteboards in teaching, or even work collaboratively (not real-time) in developing diagrams together as a team.

**Additional context**
We do host our own gitlab, nextcloud, etc. (even a Confluence wiki).","2023-07-19T12:07:54Z","2023-07-19T12:15:14Z","GDPR","General Data Protection Regulation"

<!-- Describe the change proposed in this pull request -->

Default the consent- check to undefined if there is no consent data available and cancel module initialization only if gdpr or usp is available (and consent is not given).

This change allows the module to be used in regions where gdpr/usp does not apply and in environments where consent is handled in a non- standard way.

📋 **Task Description**
The technical task at hand involves implementing Google Analytics into your website while ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Google Analytics is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into user behavior and website performance. However, because it involves the collection of user data, it's essential to implement it in a way that respects user privacy and complies with GDPR regulations.

💡 **Insights**
- Google Analytics provides an option to anonymize IP addresses by adding the following code snippet to the tracking code:
```js
ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);
```
- You can find resources and documentation on implementing Google Analytics and cookie consent banners on the Google Analytics and GDPR official websites.
👍 **Acceptance Criteria**
-    The Google Analytics tracking code is successfully integrated into all website pages.
-    IP addresses are anonymized in the Google Analytics configuration.
 -   A cookie consent banner is displayed on the website, clearly informing users about the use of cookies, including Google Analytics cookies.

## Removed Adapters

### Reason 1 - known to be deprecated or out of business

applogy, rhythmone, engagebdr

### Reason 2 - refusal to establish or confirm a working group contact email address
_The following adapters have an invalid email address (mail bounced) or have an individual contact rather than a group mailbox. The adapters were removed for being in violation of Global Module Rule 1 of the [Prebid Module Rules](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/module-rules.html#module-rules). Adapters are welcomed to return to the project at any time by providing an updated email address. If you need help restoring a removed adapter from the git history, please open a ticket and we'll be delighted to assist._

PBS-Go: kubient, nanointeractive, ninthdecimal
PBS-Java: definemedia, kubient, nanointeractive, ninthdecimal, yeahmobi

**Define Media and yeahmobi provided updated email addresses after PBS-Java 2.0 was released and before PBS-Go 2.0 was released. They will be added back to PBS-Java 2.x in the future.**

## Other Changes

- Case insensitive biddercodes (#2400 )

## PBS-Go Specific Changes

### JSON Encoding Library
The `encoding/json` package from the standard Go library is replaced by [JSON-Iterator](https://jsoniter.com/) in core code (not yet adapters), resulting in a 300% performance improvement for encoding/decoding OpenRTB payloads. We'll extend this change into adapters once the dust settles.

We tried to find a more performant library 100% compatible with the standard Go `encoding/json` package. Despite many claims, no such library exists. The closest we've found is JSON-Iterator.

There are some subtle changes we had to account for, such as a null `json.RawMessage` being represented as `nil` instead of previously as the literal characters ""null"". Error messages are different and harder to parse in the JSON-Iterator library. We've added a rather hacky translation which we hope to improve when JSON-Iterator error handling improves to look more like that of the standard library.

### Hard Coded Aliases

We've improved the setup of hardcoded aliases, streamlining the process to require just one configuration file and no code. Half of the aliases are migrated in 2.0 and rest will be migrated in 2.1.

### Remove Config Backwards Compatibility

In previous updates to Prebid Server 0.x, we've strived to preserve backward compatibility with deprecated configuration. In this release, we've discontinued this backward compatibility as part of a tech debt cleanup effort.

#### blacklisted_accts
Blacklisted accounts are removed. Please use the account configuration system instead. To deny access to specific accounts, enable `account_required` to `true` and configure a backend account data storage which can be either the local file system (with config deployed using Kubernetes) or HTTP call. Support for database MySQL and Postgres backends are in the works.

#### gdpr.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose

 `gdpr.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose` no longer supports a string and must now be specified as a bool indicating whether or not the purpose should be enforced. Previously, the enforcement algorithm for a given purpose could be specified through this field by setting it to ""full"", ""basic"" or ""none"". The enforcement algorithm should now be specified using `gdpr.purpose{1-10}.enforce_algo`.
 
 #### ccpa/gdpr.integration_enabled
 
This release removes backwards compatibility for deprecated host and account configuration options:
- `ccpa.integration_enabled`
- `gdpr.integration_enabled`

Instead, hosts should use `ccpa.channel_enabled` and `gdpr.channel_enabled` respectively in account configs.
For example:
```
""gdpr"": {
    ""channel_enabled"": {
      ""web"": true,
      ""app"": false,
      ""dooh"": true,
      ""amp"": false,
      ""video"": true
    }
}
```

#### {stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.postgres

The release removes support for the following host options:
`{stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.postgres.`
- `connection.dbname`
- `connection.host`
- `.connection.port`
- `.connection.user`
- `.connection.password`
- `.connection.query_string`
- `.connection.tls.root_cert`
- `.connection.tls.client_cert`
- `.connection.tls.client_key`
- `.fetcher.query`
- `.fetcher.amp_query`
- `.initialize_caches.timeout_ms`
- `.initialize_caches.query`
- `.initialize_caches.amp_query`
- `.poll_for_updates.refresh_rate_seconds`
- `.poll_for_updates.timeout_ms`
- `.poll_for_updates.query`
- `.poll_for_updates.amp_query`

Instead, hosts should use `.database` instead of `.postgres` when setting these fields.
e.g. `{stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.database.connection.dbname`.

It should also be noted that since we now need to use the generic `.database` in our path, we must also set the driver as such: `{stored_requests/stored_video_req/stored_responses}.database.connection.driver`.

#### events_enabled

The host configuration `events_enabled` is removed. Instead, use `account_defaults.events.enabled` in the host config and `events.enabled` in account configs.

#### enable_gzip

The `enable_gzip` configuration value is removed. This controls if the host can respond with gzip'd payloads and has nothing to do with communication with bidders.  Instead, hosts should use `compression.response.enable_gzip`.

#### stored_requests.filesystem

The `stored_requests.filesystem` and `stored_requests.directorypath` values are removed. Instead, use 
 `stored_requests.filesystem.enabled` and `stored_requests.filesystem.path`, respectively.

#### gdpr.tcf2

- `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enabled` is replaced by `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose`.
- `gdpr.tcf2.purpose_one_treatement.*` is replaced by `gdpr.tcf2.purpose_one_treatment.*`, fixing a typo.
- `gdpr.tcf2.special_purpose1.*` is replaced by `gdpr.tcf2.special_feature1.*`, changing the word purpose to feature to better match the TCF2 spec.

String data type support for `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enforce_purpose` is removed. This field must now be specified as a bool. Previously, the enforcement algorithm for a given purpose could be specified through this field by setting it to ""full"", ""basic"" and ""none"". This should now be specified using `gdpr.tcf2.purpose{1-10}.enforce_algo`.

#### usersync_url

The adapter `usersync_url` configuration value is removed. This used to be the only way to configure a user sync url before we refactored and introduced usersync config. Hosts may have needed to override this value to enable user sync for some bidders. The backwards compatibility was limited to adapters which supported either iframe or redirect usersync, but not both.

Instead, please use the `userSync.iframe.url` and or `userSync.redirect.url` config of the new adapter `usersync` config.","2023-09-01T19:28:42Z","2023-10-25T13:30:04Z","GDPR","GDPR"

Scientific Python offered us to use their plausible instance for our website analytics. [Plausible](https://plausible.io) self-describes as

> No cookies and fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR

and should hopefully gain us some insights into our users in a privacy-friendly manner.

Documentation for the inclusion in our theme can be found here: https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/analytics.html

I am not yet sure how and who will be able to access the reports at https://views.scientific-python.org but @stefanv would know more.

After adding this we could also think about adding it to our main page and possibly shoehorn into our old HTML docs. Not sure if the latter is worth it though. I am mainly interested in which part of our documentation get accessed most or least.

## **Background**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->

EU laws require people to explicitly consent to collect their data as the IP address is considered personal data. In our case, we collect IP location data, and it is crucial to introduce a mechanism to obtain user consent for this specific data processing.

## **Proposal**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->

In order to achieve GDPR compliance, we need to implement a user notification banner that informs users about the usage of their data and allows them to either accept or reject it.

When users choose to reject the usage of their data, a header should be added to requests to prevent the collection of their IP.

We could use the following plugin https://github.com/orestbida/cookieconsent

Presses and journals often want to offer a signup form on their website where users can submit their email address and be added to mailing lists via services like MailChimp. This is sometimes tricky given our data protection obligations and commitments.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Add a setting for a URL that can be used as the action URL on a custom POST form. Such a form can be nearly fully controlled by a custom Django component and template, except for the action URL. MailChimp and potentially other services can generate an action URL, but since it contains unique IDs related to a single MailChimp account, I don't want to commit it with the template and would rather store it in the database.

As an example, with MailChimp, the user is taken to a form where they enter other details like name and institution, as configured via MailChimp. They then have to pass a captcha and agree to terms before signing up. Note that MailChimp offers the option to configure GDPR settings.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A less intelligent link to a signup form, without sending a POST request from Janeway. This would not be as good a user experience because the user can't enter anything on Janeway, only on the secondary MailChimp form.

   your app, reach out to our support team on the
   [Developer Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!categories/google-admob-ads-sdk/game-engines).
  * For assistance with your AdMob account, reach out to
   [AdMob Support](https://support.google.com/admob/?hl=en#topic=7383088).
  * For feedback on [our documentation](https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/start),
   send  your feedback by pressing the **Send Feedback** button at the top right of the
    documentation page you are on.
  * For issues related to __the code in this repository__, continue filing this GitHub issue.

  * Once you've read this section and determined that your issue is appropriate for
    this repository, **please delete this section**.

### [REQUIRED] Step 1: Describe your environment

  * Unity version: 2021.3.9f1
  * Google Mobile Ads Unity plugin version: 8.5.2
  * Platform: Android, iOS (iOS, Android, Unity Editor)
  * Platform OS version: iOS 17, Android 14
  * Any specific devices issue occurs on: All
  * Mediation ad networks used, and their versions: IronSource 7.5.3, Applovin 5.9.0

I followed the setup guide here and am getting a consent form popup working on my mobile app: https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/privacy

It looks like Unity doesn't return anything, and Admob is smart enough to know what the user selected without any developer intervention.

However, what about other ad networks?  Since I am using Admob's UMP, do I need to parse the [TC String](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#creating-a-tc-string) made by UMP and handle other ad networks in my own code, or is it expected that other ad networks will find and read this TC String and operate normally?","2023-10-24T13:41:02Z","2023-11-18T00:05:58Z","GDPR","GDPR"

**Describe the bug**

As long as Google Pay is provided in the Checkout, a connection to fonts.googleapis.com is made

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. In the consent manager of your choice (we use consentmanager.net) don't allow google fonts
2. Go to checkout (Onestep checkout)
3. Check the network tab
4. Google fonts are loaded

**Expected behavior**

Google fonts are only loaded if the user gives consent.

**Magento version**
2.4.5

**Plugin version**

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux, Windows
 - Browser Chrome
 - Version 117

**Additional context**

In Germany there are was a wave of cease and desist letters to not use Google Fonts, so this is a quite important topic.

I guess it would be okay to load google fonts as soon as Google Pay is selected, but it is loading initially on opening the checkout.

Can this be optimized?","2023-10-31T11:04:23Z","2024-06-05T13:39:10Z","GDPR","GDPR"

We will drop current `db-tools:anonymization:run`/`db-tools:anonymize` command.

This command will be use like this:

```
1. backup current database
2. import given backup file
3. anonymize database
4. export database overwriting the given backup file
5. restore initial database backup

The documentation will describe a *fully* GDPR-compatible workflow :

1. On your prod env launch : `db-tools:backup`
2. Download this backup file on a secured environment (like a preprod)
3. launch `db-tools:anonymize /path/to/my/backup` on this secured environment
4. download and restore the anonymized backup on your local machine

The `db-tools:anonymize` command will also start by warn user that he should not run this command on an ensecured env.

The command could be run with a `--current-database` then it will behavior like the old version of `db-tools:anonymize`.

The command will be interactive by default (ask if, you want to backup/restore the current database)but should be launch with `-n` if you want to run it the classic way (with a backup and a restore of the current state)","2023-12-14T15:27:03Z","2023-12-20T15:10:44Z","GDPR","GDPR"

Steps to reproduce the problem: 
1. Enable GDPR in the backend
2. Register as a new user
3. Request account deletion
4. Go to the QueuedEmails, see that there is no emails in there.

Living and working in Germany constantly exposes us to GDPR. Recently we had a customer try out the GDPR deletion of customers. Our customer expected that the user would be instantly deleted and be unable to login to the store instantly. We were able to explain our customer that this might not be the right behavior, because of open, unpaid orders in example. 

After that explanation, we and the customer, understand that manual review of the GDPR deletion requests is required. After checking the code we found out, that there is no email send out to the store owner when somebody requests their deletion. 

At this point, it's only possible to identify if a user wants to be deleted by accidentally visiting the GDPR log page in the backend. As there can also be many other GDPR logs in this table, beside customer deletion requests, it is then required to search for a special text to identify users that need to be reviewed and eventually deleted.

This is a time consuming and error prone setup. Additionally GDPR requires us to process the deletion requests in a timely manner. That's why we would expect that the store owner receives an deletion request email, so he can take immediate action.","2023-12-15T10:36:15Z","2023-12-20T11:35:37Z","GDPR","GDPR"

## Proposed Changes

* This passes in the cart contents as a string (instead of passing in the transaction/order ID) as the conversion label in Parsely. Parsely does not support more complex objects, but this will give us an indication of which products are converting vs. which blog posts.

## Testing Instructions

<!--
Add as many details as possible to help others reproduce the issue and test the fix.
""Before / After"" screenshots can also be very helpful when the change is visual.
-->

* If in GDPR, allow ""analytics"" tracking. If you're testing locally, either temporarily change `development.json` to allow `ad-tracking` and `cookie-banner`, or pass these in as `?flags=ad-tracking,cookie-banner` in the URL on the checkout page.
* Make sure that you see calls to parsely.com in the network tab. They should look similar to this:
    * `https://cdn.parsely.com/keys/wordpress.com/p.js?ver=3.3.2` for loading the base tracking code
    * `http://p1.parsely.com/plogger/?rand=1704198873194....` for sending off the tracking call, where the key prop is `data` containing the cart items, e.g. `{""_conversion_type"":""purchase"",""_conversion_label"":""personal-bundle, dotblog_domain""}` 
    * You will also see one more `/plogger` call that fires off a pageview event.
* If tracking is disallowed (the user has not consented, or explicitly opted out of analytics, no tracking calls should be made.
